# Publishing and Sharing

There are number of different ways to share and publish your work on
the RC. This functionality can be accessed using the object menu (i.e. clicking
the menu icon) for the given work or exposition on the My Profile page.

### Share

Works and expositions can be shared. They can be made public (visible
to anyone on the internet), private, or visible to RC users only. As
long as the object has not been published it remains editable.

### Self-Publish

Self-publishing makes an exposition no longer editable and publicly visible.

### Submit for Publication

Expositions can be submitted to portals (such as journals) for
publication. Click "submit unlimited publication to" and select the
portal. While the exposition is in review it can no longer be
edited. The portal admin or editor will contact you regarding the
reviewing process.

### Connect to Portal

A work or exposition can be connected to a portal without being
published by the portal. The portal admin will receive a notification
and has to confirm the connection. Once the connection has been
approved it will be shown in the object's metadata and the object may
appear on the portal page and portal feeds. Connected works may for example
accompany a published exposition or represent a connected event.
