# Publishing and Sharing

There are number of different ways to share and publish your work on
the RC. This functionality can be accessed using the object menu
(i.e. clicking the menu icon) for the given work or exposition on the
"My Profile"-page.

### Share

Share is used to control access/visibility of works and expositions. By default all works and expositions are __private__, changing the mode allows others to see your work.

The share option can be found under the object menu (<img class="tiny_icon" src="images/menu.png" alt="hamburger menu icon">) of each object on your profile. 

There are four modes available:

* __private__ (__default__) : only visible to you or the [collaborators](#collaborating-on-research "collaboration") on that specific object.
* __only RC users__ : visible to RC users only. 
* __limited to portal__: You can make your exposition visible only to members of a certain portal. Clicking a portal in the list below, toggles visibity of your exposition for members of that portal. If required, you can also select multiple.
* __public__ : visible to anyone on the internet. 

Finally, there is the option to make the object available trough a link (comparible to link sharing in Google Drive):

* __link share__ : The object is accessible through a "secret" link. Only people that know the link can view the object. This is useful for sharing with readers without an RC account.

### Self-Publish

Self-publishing makes an exposition __no longer editable__ and publicly
visible. On publication you will get a (free) [DOI](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier). 

### Submit for Publication

Expositions can be submitted to portals (such as journals) for
publication. Click "submit unlimited publication to" and select the
portal. While the exposition is in review it can no longer be
edited. The portal admin or editor will contact you regarding the
reviewing process.

### Connect to Portal

A work or exposition can be connected to a portal without being
published by the portal. The portal admin will receive a notification
and has to confirm the connection. Once the connection has been
approved it will be shown in the object's metadata and the object may
appear on the portal page and portal feeds. Connected works may for
example accompany a published exposition or represent a connected
event.
