# Publishing and Sharing

There are number of different ways to share and publish your work on
the RC. This functionality can be accessed using the object menu (â˜°) for the given work or exposition on your profile page. 

It is important to be aware of the difference between __sharing__ and __publishing__:
when an exposition is __shared__, content can still be changed, and the mode of sharing can be changed at a later point.

__Publication__, however, is permanent. This means that once an exposition is published, all content will be locked. The idea behind this, is that the content of a published expositions can be safely referenced by others, without risk of linking to something that has changed or dissapeared. 

### Share

Share is used to control access/visibility of works and expositions. By default all works and expositions are __private__, changing the mode allows others to see your work. Unlike __publishing__, you will still be able to change the content of the exposition when it is shared.

The share option can be found under the object menu (<img class="tiny_icon" src="images/menu.png" alt="hamburger menu icon">) of each object on your profile. 

There are four modes available:

* __private__ (__default__) : only visible to you or the [collaborators](#collaborating-on-research "collaboration") on that specific object.
* __only RC users__ : visible to users with an RC account.
* __limited to portal__: visible only to members of a certain portal within RC. Clicking a portal in the list below, toggles visibity of your exposition for members of that portal. If required, you can also select multiple.
* __public__ : visible to anyone on the internet. 

Independent of the above choice there is a check box:

* __link share__ : The object is accessible through a "secret" link. Only people that have the link can view the object. This is useful for sharing with readers without an RC account, by turning the option on and mailing them the link.

Link share can be combined with any of the other sharing modes (private, RC users, limited to portal, public). An exposition can for example be shared within a portal but simultaniously be accessible through the "secret" link.

### Self-Publish

Self-publishing makes an exposition __no longer editable__ and publicly
visible. On publication you will get a (free) [DOI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier). By design, publishing an exposition is not reversible (so others can use the exposition link as a reference).

### Submit for Publication

Expositions can also be submitted to portals (such as journals) for
publication. Before submitting to a portal, you should probably first check what requirements a portal has for submissions.
Most of the portals will only accept requests from within the institution that is associated with it.
Click "submit unlimited publication to" and select the
portal. While the exposition is in review it can no longer be
edited. The portal admin or editor will contact you regarding the
reviewing process. Once an exposition is published, it's content can never be changed.

### Connect to Portal

A work or exposition can be connected to a portal without being
published by the portal. The portal admin will receive a notification
and has to confirm the connection. Once the connection has been
approved it will be shown in the object's metadata and the object may
appear on the portal page and portal feeds. Connected works may for
example accompany a published exposition or represent a connected
event.
