# Groups

Groups are a feature to make it easier to use the Research Catalogue with a
group of users, for example for use in a class, research project or workshop. As
a member of the group, you get access to the groups overview page, which shows
all users and expositions connected to the group as well as general information.
As a member, you can create your own expositions within the group, that will be
directly visible to all the group's members.

The group may also have one or more admins (administrators). The group's admins
have the ability to manage the members, expositions and edit the description and
other metadata. They can also set collaborations for the expositions that are
connected to the group.

The group's overview page can be something that is private to the group members,
but may also be shared within the portal or public. 

User groups are created by portals. Each group can have one or more admins that
administrate the group's content. The groups of a portal can be found on the
[portal feed page](https://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/institutions).

# Using the group as a member

There are two ways to become part of a group:

1. The group's admin invites you. You can accept the request in the [collaboration]("RC collaboration section" https://www.researchcatalogue.net/collaboration/list) section. 
2. You visit a public group page and request membership. In this case the admin will have to accept you.

Once you are a member you can \[visit the group\] from your own [profile page]("my profile page" https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile).

# Visibility

The group may be:

- __private__: visible only to its members and the portal admin 
- __visible within the portal__: only members of the portal can see it
- __public__: visible to all

Expositions connected to the group can be seen by all members (even if they are
otherwise private). The visibility of expositions of non-members of the group
are controlled by each individual exposition share or publication status. 

If a group is public, other visitors will only see expositions that are
explicitely made public. This means there is the possibility to have private
expositions that are only visible to members of the group but not to anybody
else.

### Group page

![example group page](images/group-page.png "group page")

A group page has a title, description, status, preview image and member list.
Group pages can be found on the portal feed page. When you are admin of the
group, you can set these by clicking edit details.

### Roles within Groups

There are two roles within the group:


1. __Members__:
    * Can view the project page and all expositions within it.
    * Can send a request to connect a exposition from them to a project.
2. __Admins__:
    * Can view the project page and all expositions within it.
    * Invite other users to the group.
    * Accept/reject exposition connection requests.
    * Change visibility of the group.

A group can have any number of admins/members. Users can request membership to a
group by visiting the group page and click "request to become a member". 

Admins will be notified when a connection has been requested, or when a user
indicated they want to become member of the group. The exposition connections
can be accepted within the connections page of the Group.

When an admin invites a user to become admin or member, the invited user will
have to confirm membership first in __collaboration__.

### Creating a group

A group can be created by the portal admin, see admin reference
