# Groups

Groups are a feature to make it easier to use the Research Catalogue with a group of users, for example for use in a class, research project or workshop. The users that are members of the group have a shared profile page, where they can easily read and collaborate on each others expositions. When ready, this group page may also be made visible to the public. 

User groups can be created by portals. Each group can have one or more admins that administrate the group's content. The groups of a portal can be found on the [portal feed page](https://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/institutions).

The group may be:

- __private__: visible only to its members and the portal admin 
- __visible within the portal__: only members of the portal can see it
- __public__: visible to all

Expositions connected to the group can be seen by all members (even if they are otherwise private). 
If a group is public, other visitors will only see expositions that are explicitely made public.
This means there can be private expositions that are visible to members of the group but not to the rest of the RC.

### Group page

![example group page](images/group-page.png "group page")

A group page has a title, description, status, preview image and member list. Group pages can be found on the portal feed page. When you are admin of the group, you can set these by clicking edit details.

### Roles within Groups

There are two roles within the group:


1. __Members__:
    * Can view the project page and all expositions within it.
    * Can send a request to connect a exposition from them to a project.
2. __Admins__:
    * Can view the project page and all expositions within it.
    * Invite other users to the group.
    * Accept/reject exposition connection requests.
    * Change visibility of the group.

A group can have any number of admins/members. Users can request membership to a group by visiting the group page and click "request to become a member". 

Admins will be notified when a connection has been requested, or when a user indicated they want to become member of the group. The exposition connections can be accepted within the connections page of the Group.

When an admin invites a user to become admin or member, the invited user will have to confirm membership first in __collaboration__.

### Creating a group

A group can be created by the portal admin, see admin reference admin-groups](#admin-groups)
