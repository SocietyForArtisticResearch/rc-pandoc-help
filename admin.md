### add / edit a user

#### profile

An administrator can also change these fields without having to change the password (by leaving the field empty).

#### portal
This controls to which portals a user is added. A user can be added to multiple portals at once. Portals which are selected are marked by a gray background.

#### roles
When the option is turned on, the user cannot create any content. The can still become supervisors or read expositions.

#### settings
Here you can set which emails the user should receive.

### log in as a user
While logged in as another user, you will see a red bar on the top of your window that shows who you are and enables you to switch back to your own account. This feature is useful while helping somebody with issues specific to their account.

Keep in mind: you become this user in all the tabs of your browser window, so you would temporarly loose some of you admin permissions while navigating as this user.

The portal tab shows you which users are administrators on the portal.
It has 3 actions:

| Action              | Icon                                                |
