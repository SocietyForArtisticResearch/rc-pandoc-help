# Licenses

Authors can choose different licenses for both their expositions and media.  A license can help make clear under what conditions you allow
your material to be (re)used. All rights reserved is the most strict: it means that people have to get your permission to use any material. The motivation to publish under a more liberal Creative Commons license, is that it makes it easier for your materials to be used and distributed by others.

Peer-reviewed journals may have differing views on licenses, usually based on the requirements of Open Access.

You can get help choosing the right license on the Creative Commons website:
<https://creativecommons.org/choose/> and <https://creativecommons.org/faq/>.
