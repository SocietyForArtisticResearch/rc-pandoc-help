</td><td>Video Upload Issue
</td><td><p>Video Upload Issues:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently we are investigating an issue regarding the uploading of large video files (&gt; 400MB). It appears that uploads sometimes break off around point, without reporting any error. Most uploads below that size do not appear to suffer from the problem. A tempory solution is splitting the video in parts with iMovie, Windows Movie Maker or the terminal tool ffmpeg*.<br><br>Together with the developers we are trying to find a permanent solution, we will inform you as soon as this is working correctly again. Meanwhile, we are sorry for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* = ffmpeg is a terminal tool, but quite easy to use see: http://j4n.co/blog/easily-split-videos-with-ffmpeg.</p>

</td><td>Warning messages (font and zoom) in viewer
</td><td><p>When a page is opened in a browser, the text is actually rendered by the browser dependent on the browser version, the operating system and the fonts that are installed on the computer. This can lead to research appearing differently in different environments. In order to at least highlight issues, we included a message at the top of each page if (1) a font that is needed is not installed (2) the zoom factor is not set to 100%. These messages can be closed so as not to impact on the viewing experience.</p>
</td><td></td></tr><tr>
<td>28/10/2014
</td><td>Setting tool template in a research exposition
</td><td><p>The initial values of the tools in the toolbox can now be adjusted by double-clicking on a tool in the tool box (rather than dragging it onto the page as usual). For example, a double click on the text tool lets you set the standard size of a text tool making it unnecessary to manually adjust the tool every time it is used.</p>
<p>Note: tool templates are set for all tools in an exposition; the settings work for all contributors but only within a single exposition.</p>
</td><td></td></tr><tr>
<td>28/10/2014
</td><td>Slide show automation
</td><td><p>It is now possible to play/autoplay the slide show. In the slide show properties, a new section in the options tab ('automate') allows to set the mode (no, start on click or start on page load) as well as the amount of time each slide is displayed for.</p>
<p>Note: when the slide show is set to start/pause on click, it is not possible to enlarge an individual image per click in a popover. In this case, the tick box 'on click open image in pop up' in options &gt; settings will be disabled and its value reset. A message will indicate this.</p>
</td><td></td></tr><tr>
<td>19/09/2014
</td><td>Text on hover
</td><td><p>It is now possible to display an additonal text as the mouse pointer moves over the tool. Previously, it was only possible to display copyright information (which some people misused in order to display a different text). If text and copyright is to be shown, the copyright will be shown below a line at the bottom of the text. The text can be entered in the tool's properties, option tab.</p>
</td><td></td></tr><tr>
<td>18/09/2014
</td><td>Loading animation as page loads
</td><td><p>Tools that are still loading when a page is opened are now shown with a gif in the centre in order to indicate that content in this area of the page is still loading. In small pages with few images, this will be next to invisible.</p>
</td><td></td></tr><tr>
<td>18/09/2014
</td><td>New Tool: Object Viewer
</td><td><p>The objet viewer allows to display 3D objects that can be turned on mouse move. We opted for a very simple implementation, which requires a set of images to be uploaded in a zip archive that show the object from all (necessary) sides. See&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thoro.de/page/3dnp-introduction-en" target="_blank">http://www.thoro.de/page/3dnp-introduction-en</a> for a description of the process and a Blender script.</p>
<p>Note: Blender is not straightforward to use. In time, we will develop an extended help file for this. We may also work towards alternative solutions for the generation of those images.</p>
</td><td></td></tr><tr>
<td>05/09/2014
</td><td>Submission notification
</td><td><p>A user who submits his/her research to a portal will now receive a message that the research has been received by the portal and that contact will be made. This is meant to reassure a user about what is actually happening. Previously, the research was simply set to 'in review'.</p>
</td><td></td></tr><tr>
<td>25/08/2014
</td><td>undo changes/restore deleted tools
</td><td><p>There is now a new tab 'history' in every tools properties, which can be accessed bu double-clicking on that tool. 'History' shows a list of changes to that tool. By clicking the respective 'restore' button, a previous version of that tool can be restored.</p>
<p>Furthermore, should a tool have been deleted, it is now possible to undelete the tool. In the workspace under the commands-tab, click 'restore deleted tools' in order to see all tools on a page that have been deleted. Press 'restore' of the desired tool to restore this tool. Go to the tools history to return to a previous version should this be necessary.</p>
</td><td></td></tr><tr>
<td>22/08/2014
</td><td>Double-blind peer review
</td><td><p>Reviewers can now be assigned to a submission either as single or as double-blind reviewers. If the latter is chosen, the auther name is (where possible) made anonymous (for example, the HOME menu or the reference and whereever the exact user name appears as text in an exposition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if the spelling is different, or if the name appears in supporting documents (say a pdf or in a video) the RC will not be able to anonymise this. It has to be picked up in the editorial process and blocked.</p>
</td><td></td></tr><tr>
<td>21/08/2014
</td><td>update notification
</td><td><p>All Administrators and Portal-Administrators will now receive notifications of updates to the RC added to this page&nbsp;<a href="http://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/updates/">http://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/updates/</a></p>

</td><td>Message notifications
</td><td><p>Messages sent to a user by either the RC or another user are now send as part of the notification email. When a user receives a message, he or she does now not need to log into the RC to read it. However, in order yo reply, the user will need to click on the reply link at the bottom of the notification, which takes him or her to the RC messaging system where the reply needs to be entered.</p>
</td><td></td></tr><tr>
<td>21/08/2014
</td><td>Hiding notes
</td><td><p>If a user hides notes (in preview, menu: reviewing &gt; hide notes), those notes now remain hidden even after a refresh. Before, a user needed to hide them again, after the page was refreshed.</p>
</td><td></td></tr><tr>
<td>12/08/2014

</td><td>Changes to the RC workspace
</td><td><p>The RC workspace layout was simplified.</p>
<p>There is now only one menu bar at the very top. Additional functions have been moved to the 'Commands' tab below the toolbox, or, if they are tool specific, they can be accessed with a right-click on the respective tool on the page to open its context menu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commands tab:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overview: shows to overview panel to the right and the order in which tools are layered on a page</li>
<li>Text changes: responds to the track-changes function within text tools. If on, text is shown <em>after</em> the edit; if off, text is shown <em>before</em> the edit. This setting influences also the preview mode.</li>
