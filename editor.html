<h4 id="note-view">note-view</h4>
<p>The note-view was created to streamline the use of the [note tool](. Notes were conceived as a possibilty to make small conversations about specific problems directly at the mentioned content, like sticky notes. Because the usage of notes can be confusing from time to time we developed the note-view. To activate the note-view click on the buttons top-right on the view-options. A new window or tab will open and show you all notes listes aside the layout and the other content of your exposition. You can sort and filter the view with the filter options on the top of the browser. You can sort by the owner or by the assignee of the note or of the resolution, which means, if the note is open to clear or is already cleared.</p>
<p>Next to each note you can find: the notes' status options, who created the note and who is responsible for clearance (useful if there is more than one author to a project). You can limit the clearance to a date and close open notes with the status pull-down-men.</p>
<p>The note view can be closed by clicking &quot;close note view&quot;.</p>
<h4 id="text-view">text-view</h4>
<p>Sometimes it can be confusing to retrace all the changes in one or more text(s) while editing the exposition. The text-view shields the texts from the grafic and media-content from your exposition. You can activate the text-view by clicking on the button on the view-options. You have the opportunity to show or hide the changes of a text. You can also sort the items and open the html-editor to make changes directly in the text-view.</p>
<p>The text view can be closed by clinging &quot;close text view&quot;.</p>
