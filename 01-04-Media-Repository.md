# Media Repository

The media repository is where you can opload and organise your
media. It includes all the media used in your expositions, so
everything listed under "simple media" tab in the graphical
editor. You can upload media, organise it into [__sets__](#sets) and [__share__](#share_media) it with other
users of the RC. It extends and replaces the old "Works" feature.

### Browsing

There are three sections:

* __My sets__

	Your media sets.
	
* __Shared with you__

	Media sets that have been shared with you by others.
	
* __Media__

	The complete list of all media.
	
All overviews are sortable, click on a column to sort by this.

### Filter 

The filter can be used to only show certain types of media. You can filter by 
Tags, Keywords or Date.


### Creating new media

There are various ways to create new media:

* Upload

Click "__upload media__" to add a new file. You will be asked at a minimum
to provide a copyright holder, if you are the creator, you can fill in
your own name here. 

### Multi-upload

When you select multiple files to upload, they will be displayed as
multiple forms. You can copy over the album and copyright fields.

### Text

You can also create snippets of text by using the "__create text__" button.
You can select between three different type:

* plain text
* HTML
* Markdown 

### Sets

Media can be organised in Sets. Media can belong to multiple sets at
once. You can create a new set and by clicking " select" you can
choose what media belongs to that set.

### Open Keywords, Closed Keywords, Tags

Tags are meant for personal organistion, for example todo, old,
archive, new, music, in progress, history etc.. They are private to
your rc account, so no other users will see them.

### Open keywords

Open keywords are shared with the whole RC, any user add any new term
to the global namespace. 

You can either search for existing Open Keywords or create your own,
if the term has not been used before.

To prevent duplicates, the RC does not
differerentiate between various capitalizations, for example: "Art" &
"art" are understood to be the same thing.

### Closed Keywords

Closed keywords are from a controlled vocabulary. They are chosen so that we
can more easily interact with other repositories. They cannot be extended by 
individual users.
