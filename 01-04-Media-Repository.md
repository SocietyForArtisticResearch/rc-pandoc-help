New RC Feature: Media Repository

We are happy to announce the upcoming release of a new RC feature. The
new media repository allows RC users to navigate, organize and manage
all of their media. Each user can browse and search the media that is
used in their expositions or collect media files and texts with which
to create an exposition later. The media repository facilitates
metadata editing, sharing, categorizing data, note taking, personal
and collective storage. It is the first use of the new media API,
which will enable the RC to be linked to external repositories as
well. The repository is fully responsive and will work on mobile
devices.

# Media Repository

The media repository allows RC users to navigate, organize and manage
their media. Each user can browse the media that is used in their
expositions (the [simple
media](https://guide.researchcatalogue.net/#simple-media)) or collect
media files and texts with which to create an exposition later. Beyond
organizing media, you can share it with other users of the RC. You can
upload media, organize it into [__sets__](#sets) and
[__share__](#share_media) it with other users of the RC. It extends
and replaces the older "Works" feature.


### Browsing


The media browser contains three tabs:

* __Media__

	The complete list of all media.

* __My sets__

	Your media sets.
	
* __Sets shared with you__

	Media sets that have been shared with you by others.
	
	
There are two ways of displaying the media or sets:

* The __gallery view__ displays a preview image of the entities and
  helps finding media visually.
* The __list view__ is better suited for sorting media or sets.  Click
  on a column to sort a list by a certain property.

### Filter and Search

The filter can be used to only show certain types of media. You can filter by 
[__tags__](#tags), [__keywords__](#keywords), date and media type.


### Creating new media

There are various ways to create new media:

### Upload

Click "__Upload media__" to add a new file. Once you have select one or
more files, you will be asked to provide at least copyright
information. If you are the creator, you can fill in your own name
here.

Accepted types:

* Video (most common formats)
* Audio
* PDF
* Text files: plain / html / markdown
* Images : .png .gif .jpg .svg .tiff

__Transcoding audio and video:__

The Media Repository accepts all common audio and video formats and
will automatically convert them to web compatible format.  Audio is
transcoded to 256 kbps mp3, video to mp4 with the original resolution.

### Multi-upload

You can select multiple files to upload at once or a folder containing
several files. You will be presented with a form block for each
file. In order to ease such a workflow you can apply the copyright
information and the set you want to add the media to from one form to
all other forms.


### Text

Text is a media type in the media repository.

You can also create snippets of text by using the "__create text__" button.
You can select between three different type:


* Plain text
* HTML
* Markdown 

## Metadata

Every album and media entry is linked to set of metadata that include
copyright and licensing information as well as a title and the
following fields:

### Description

The description is not typically displayed for a reader of an
exposition but allows the author to provide additional information.

<a id="tags">
### Tags

Tags are meant for personal organization. Typical examples would be
"todo", "old", "archive", "new", or "in progress". They are private to
your RC account, so no other users will see them.

<a id="keywords">
### Open Keywords

Open keywords are shared with the entire RC, any user can add any new
term to the global namespace.

You can either search for existing open keywords or create your own,
if the term has not been used before.

To prevent duplicates, the RC does not differentiate between upper and
lower case, for example: "Art" and "art" are understood to be the same
thing.

### Closed Keywords

Closed keywords are part of a closed and controlled vocabulary
administered and continuously extended by the RC. They are chosen so
that we can more easily interact with other repositories. They cannot
be extended by individual users.


<a id="sets">
## Sets

Media can be organized in sets. Media can belong to multiple sets at
once. You can create a new set and by clicking "select" you can
choose the media belongs to a set.
