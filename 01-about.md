# About the Research Catalogue

The Research Catalogue (RC) is a searchable database for archiving artistic research. RC content is not peer reviewed, nor is it highly controlled for quality, being checked only for appropriateness. As a result, the RC is highly inclusive.

The open source status of the RC is essential to its nature and serves its function as a connective and transitional layer between academic discourse and artistic practice, thereby constituting a discursive field for artistic research.

The RC creates a link between

(1) elaborated documentation of the work; and

(2) expositions and comments that engage with the contribution of the work as research.

Given that the RC is a site for artistic research, to add a work is to make a claim that the work can be seen as research; through expositions, comments and articles the initial claim is transformed into an argument. It is believed that the reflective space provided by the RC can become an essential part of the research process by providing a suitable structure in which to develop the relationship between documentation and exposition, whilst also retaining congruence with art itself.

## What is an RC Exposition ?

The RC allows the inclusion of many types of media including: text, video, images and audio recordings. The way in which these materials are presented is highly customizable by the user. The exposition is edited in an in browser drag-and-drop editor. Collaboration with multiple authors in a single exposition is also possible. 

## Works ?

It is also possible to upload single or multiple files and organize them under a work, including all the relevant metadata.

## Connection between RC and JAR

Clearly, the RC is the backbone of JAR: potential JAR expositions emerge from the range of the artistic research activities taking place in it for peer-review and development within the RC space itself. Authors may nominate or JAR editors may select expositions for development as JAR contributions.

If you believe that RC software might also support your research database needs then explore the possibility of using the RC as your repository, by contacting us.

The Research Catalogue is provided by the Society for Artistic Research (SAR).
