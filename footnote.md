# Footnote

Footnotes are pop-ups that can be created within a text. The pop-up itself can contain a simple text, or a complete weave (= exposition page) if required.


## Creating a footnote

A footnote can be created within the Text or Html tool:

* Select the text that you want to become the link to the footnote. 
* Click the hyperlink button ( looks like a chainlink )
* Switch to the __footnote__ tab.
* Give it a title and change settings if needed.
* Click button __add footnote__ to finish

## Editing the content of the footnote

You can find all the footnotes you created previously under the footnotes tab, left to you screen, next to __tools__ and __commands__.
Here you can edit or delete your footnotes with the buttons provided below.

You will probably want to change the size of the footnote. This can be done by clicking the white page icon on top of the grid and filling in the values for style. (width and height).
