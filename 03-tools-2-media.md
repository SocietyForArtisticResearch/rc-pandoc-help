# Media management 

Media files can be found, uploaded, previewed and deleted in the
"Media"-tab on the right hand side. There are subtabs: __Simple Media__,
__Works__ and __"+"__, which allows the integration of external repositories,
such as the Media Archive of the Arts of the ZHdK (Madek).

## Simple Media 

The simple media, which can be found within the "Media"-tab on right
hand side of the editor. Images, videos, audio and other media that
have been added in tools onto the canvas will automatically show up in
simple media tab. You can click and drag files from the simple media
tab onto your canvas in order to create tools.

The list of media files can be sorted by type, name, creation date and
size and you can search for a file name by using the search field.

Files that are listed in gray are in the process of being transcoded.

There four buttons on top of the list of files, from left to right:

- Upload a file
- Preview a file
- Edit meta-data of the file
- Permanently delete a file from the RC (use with care)

## Works

Like simple media, works that have been added through your "My Profile Page" can also be dragged and dropped onto the canvas. Read more about adding works to your RC profile [here](#add-work).
