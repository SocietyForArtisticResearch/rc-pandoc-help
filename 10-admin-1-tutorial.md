# Portal Admin Guide

## What is a Portal?

A portal is a dedicated section within the Research Catalogue that allows institutions to organize, display, and share their research outputs and projects. A portal is autonomous: the content of a portal is not controlled or peer-reviewed by SAR, it is the institution that decides what research may be displayed or included in it. The publication policy, reviewing procedures and format requirements are also decided by the portal.

## Purpose of a Portal

* Showcase research: either by publishing as journal or provide a platform to highlight the research projects of an institution’s faculty, researchers, and students to the external visitors.

* Increase internal visibility: by making research outputs publicly accessible, the portal helps increase the visibility of the institution's research efforts.

* Facilitate collaboration: it enables collaboration among researchers by providing a space to share findings and methodologies with peers worldwide.

* Preserve Research: the portal serves as a digital archive that preserves the institution’s research outputs for future reference and use.

## Other benifits

As a portal partner you also become part of the portal community that includes access to online seminars and once a year offline portal partner meetings where member institutions exchange knowledge, share strategies, collaborate, and coordinate efforts for mutual benefit.

You can find all portals on the front page, under institutional portals, journals and projects. To start a new portal within the RC, contact <info@societyforartisticresearch.org>.

## Functionalities of a portal

To facilitate all these activities of portals, the Research Catalogue website gives portal admins access to the following special functionalities:

* Portal admins can create and manage user accounts and user roles within the portal.

* Research can be submitted, reviewed and published in the portal. Within educational environments, examination work may be submitted, reviewed and archived using the same mechanisms.

* Work in progress can be shared with other portal members or presented to external visitors by "connecting to" a group or to the portal as a whole.

* Researchers and expositions can be organized into research groups.

### Internal versus external portal

Content of a portal may be visible internally (only visible to members), externally (visible to all) or archived (hidden, only visible to admins). If desired, SAR allows institutions to create separate portals for either of these to keep them more separate. 

## Portal workflow tutorial

<a id="administration-reviewing-process"></a>

A typical portal publication workflow consists of:

* setup: creating accounts for authors
* writing: writing the content by the author(s)
* review: submitting and reviewing the exposition by reviewers
* publication 

<div class="warning">

__admin account password__

As an admin account has special abilities, it is very important that you use a strong password for your
portal admin account, as admin rights should not come in the wrong hands. You can change it under settings. 

To create a secure password, either use an automatic password manager, or use
 the following method to generate a memorable but extremely secure passphrase:
https://www.eff.org/dice. Do not use a previously used password.  

</div>

### Creating new users within the portal

Outside of portals, independent users generally register their own account using the registration page. 

However, for larger portals, it is better if the portal admin creates accounts for their users. There are two important requirements for an admin while creating an account for other users:

1. Making sure the name and email belongs to a real person (for example by linking it with an institutional account). 
2. A person should have __at most one user account__ in the RC. 

The motivation behind both of these that in case of copyright or other legal problems surrounding an account created by a portal, the portal admin should be able to provide contact information to this person. Experience tells that having two accounts for one person will guarantee undesirable mixups, especially in collaboration.

The administrator can create accounts by going to the __[admin section](https://www.researchcatalogue.net/admin)__ and opening the __user__ page. Click __create user__ at the right top corner of the screen. 

This will open a dialog where you can enter the name, email and password for the new user.

It is recommended to use a throwaway (but random!) password and ask the new user to set a proper password themselves by using the [reset link](https://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/forgotten-password). If your institution already uses a single sign on system (MS Teams, Feide), it is also possible to provide a single sign on connection to the RC, please consult SAR for this option.

#### Adding Existing Users to your Portal

Sometimes, it happens that somebody already has an account in the RC. Portal admins can also add such existing users directly to their portal. If you click "create user" in the portal's user list, typing a name of an existing user, will make it show up below the field, if you click the name and then continue to the next field, the RC will show a pop-up prompting if you want to add this user to your portal.

It is also possible for such existing users to request membership to a portal on their own account, by clicking "edit portals" on their profile page:

![requesting portal membership](images/location_of_portal_membership.jpg "member of option location on user profile")

The portal admin can accept (or reject, in case the request was made in error) such request through messages.

#### Roles 

A new account can be made as a __basic account__ or a __full account__. A basic account cannot create or publish content, and because of this, do not have to agree with the
terms of use. Basic accounts may be useful in case of creating external reviewers or supervisors.

<a id="full-account-toggle"></a>

To give an account the ability to create expositions, you have to __disable__ the "basic account" option like so:

1. click "edit" next to the user
2. open the "roles" tab
3. deselect basic user:

![removing the basic user limitation](images/full_account.jpg "user's role tab, basic account is deselected")

### Writing the Exposition, Collaboration

The next stage is the writing of the *exposition* itself. 

During the writing stage, it is common that the exposition in progress is shared with one or more other readers or collaborators. These collaborators can use the review notes system to leave feedback. There are three types of collaboration roles:

- supervisor (no edit permissions, but can leave notes)
- co author (full edit permissions)
- contributor (full edit permissions, but not mentioned in meta-data)

The author can invite RC users to these roles by going to edit details or clicking on the title of their exposition in the workspace editor and choosing "collaboration". The collaborators will receive an invitation (in RC messages) that has to be accepted before they can start to collaborate.

![collaboration tab](images/collaboration.png "the collabration tab")

It is also possible that an author makes the in-progress exposition content visible to specific groups of users, before publication. This is done by using the [share option](#share "share options in the RC"). Since sharing in this manner is not an official publication, shared expositions can be unshared (made private again), and will appear on the author's profile and not in the portal feed.

## Portal Exposition Workflow

There are two major methods of making an exposition part of a portal. The one we discussing here is __publication__, which follows a controlled, peer reviewed journal-like methodology. The exposition contents are locked during periods of review and reviewers have an overview page in the RC of expositions they need to review. The goal of such a workflow is a static online publication in the portal that cannot be edited again.

The RC also allows for a more informal connection to the portal, this is known as __"connecting to"__ a portal, where the exposition is connected to the portal, but remains editable. No review or control takes place, and the author can change content of such an exposition after the connection has been made. The "connecting to" workflow is described [here](#connecting-to-tutorial).

Below is a diagram of review, "connecting to" and sharing of expositions:

<a target="_blank" href="images/simple-exposition-portal-workflow.svg">
![exposition workflows](images/simple-exposition-portal-workflow.svg "click to open")
</a>

### Reviewing and publication

We will now describe the more official review workflow of a portal, using the submission and review facilities of the portal. 

The first step is that the author submits the exposition for review by a portal.
This is done through the ☰ menu, which is located on the "my profile" in the
right bottom corner of the exposition summary. This will open a dialog where a
portal can be chosen.


![Exposition submission dialog](images/submit_for_review.png "Dialog for submission for review")

Once the author has submitted the exposition, no further changes can be made to the exposition by the author. It will be listed on their profile under the status "in review". 

The portal admin will receive a message from the RC that a new exposition is ready for review. It will also be available under the “reviewing” section in the __[admin section](https://www.researchcatalogue.net/admin/reviewing/list)__.

The RC automatically creates a snapshot of the exposition when the author submits the exposition for review. This allows to trace between different versions of the exposition later.

If the review request was sent by accident or to the wrong portal, the publication request can be declined by the portal
administrator. The admin can also do this under __administration > reviewing__ and clicking the __X__ next to the research title. This
will also open the exposition for editing again.

#### Reviewing, Assigning Reviewers

The most common next step is to assign reviewers to this research. However, for a person to be available as reviewer, they first have to:

1. have an RC account 
2. added to the reviewer pool of the portal.

You can do so both in one go, by using "create reviewer" button on the portal ["users" list](https://www.researchcatalogue.net/admin/user/list). This will also work for users that have already an account in the RC.

The reviewer role does not require a full RC account, a basic account suffices.

For the second requirement, the user has to be added to the reviewer pool of the portal. This can be done by going to the __Portal__ page of the __[admin section](https://www.researchcatalogue.net/admin)__ and then choosing edit. Under the ROLES tab, RC users can be added as reviewers for that particular portal. 

Once a reviewer is part of the review pool, they can be added to the research exposition. To do this, go to __review__ tab of the __administration__ part of the RC, and click the edit page. Here you can add (or remove) reviewers to the research. Reviewers can be either added single blind (they cannot see each other), or double blind (they cannot see the author's name).


![the edit request page, found when clicking edit icon on an exposition in review](images/edit-request.png "edit request, within the review tab")

The reviewers will see a list of expositions that they are reviewers of on top of their "my profile" page. Within the exposition they can use the "REVIEW" menu to leave notes to themselves, which are only visible to them and the portal administrator. Typically further communication between the portal admin and the reviewer takes place through the messaging system or by e-mail.

### Optional revision of exposition content 

The expositions content is locked for the author(s) during the review process, only the portal admin can edit.  If the author needs to
revise the content, it is possible to temporarily open for editing by clicking the "in revision" button <img
class="icon" src="images/revision-action.png" />. This will open a dialog where you can put the exposition "in revision". During
revision, the exposition will remain listed in the reviewing page. Once the author is done, they can either resubmit themselves
from their profile page, or the administrator can use the button in the "reviewing" page to change the status back to "in review".

### Final Publication or Rejection

Once the review process has been completed, the portal can choose to
either publish or dismiss the exposition. If the exposition is
dismissed, this means that the editing rights are returned to the
author. The author can resubmit the same exposition later, at which
point the review process starts again. Instead of rejecting, one can
also put the exposition ["in revision"](#in-revision "in revision
documentation"), which means the author can make changes, while the
exposition is still listed on the "reviewing" tab of administration.

If the exposition is accepted, the exposition will be frozen
permanently from further changes. You will need to select a range and
an issue for the exposition to be published in.

The range controls to who the exposition will be visible:

| **range**         | **who can see it?**              |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| Limited to portal | Members of the portal can see it |
| Unlimited         | All visitors                     |
| Archived          | Portal admins                    |



*Tip: When your portal publishes its very first exposition, you will
first want to create a new issue in the
[issue](https://www.researchcatalogue.net/admin/issue/list "link to
admin issue page") page, since all expositions need to be part of an
issue. The issue's range should match that of the exposition. The
default range of an issue is unlimited.*

Issues can be used both as a grouping "master research" "research project" etc.
or for periodicals like journal issues. This is up to the portal to decide. 

![Dialog for accepting the publication request](images/accept_request.png "Dialog for accepting the request")

Depending on the portal settings at this point also a DOI will be
deposited through Crossref. Please note that publishing is meant as a
one-way step, unpublishing is to be used only as a very last resort.
If one already expects the exposition will be removed in
the future, it should not be published. In that case one could better
return the exposition to the author(s) and have them share it using
the standard sharing options of the RC.

Immediately after publication the exposition will show up on the RC
frontpage (in the case its range is Unlimited). It is recommended
that keywords are added to publications, so they can more easily be
retrieved. Keywords can also be added after publication, on the
research list.

### Connecting an exposition to the portal

The key aspect of a typical exposition publication in an RC portal is that it results in a permanent online object.

However, sometimes, it is useful to make an exposition visible on the portal page while it is still being written.
For example, in the case of an ongoing research project, where results are being added in a continuous fashion.

In this case, the author can request an exposition to be "connected to".
The portal admin will be able to accept such a request by accepting it here:  
<https://www.researchcatalogue.net/admin/part-of-requests/list>
"Connecting to" a portal is only possible if the exposition has a minimum of visiblity. This means the exposition has to be __shared__ within the portal, or fully public.
