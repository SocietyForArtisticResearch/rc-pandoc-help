<h1 id="my-profile-page">My Profile Page</h1>
<p>The RC profile page is both the central hub for your activities on the RC and a public presentation of your research activities. The RC allows you to create a detailed public profile containing biographical data, information on projects and events as well as a list of your RC objects such as works and expositions. The profile is divided into two sections, the upper sections contains an artist biography as well as information of research interests and the lower part, which is titled &quot;Research&quot; contains a list of RC works and exposition.</p>
<h2 id="profile-section">Profile Section</h2>
<h3 id="view-public-profile">View Public Profile</h3>
<p>You can switch between your profile's editing mode (private) and your public profile, which is the profile as other users see it. Click on &quot;my profile&quot; for the editing mode and - below your image - click &quot;view public profile&quot; to hide all controls, grouping options and private research. You can thus control the public visibility of your RC objects.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/view_public_profile.png" title="view public profile" alt="view public profile" />
<p class="caption">view public profile</p>
</div>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>You can add a short text (for example a biography), that other RC users will see when they visit your profile. To edit this text, click &quot;edit profile&quot;, on your profile page and scroll down. Here you can also add a tagline, set your country of residence, and list your research interests.</p>
<h3 id="uploading-a-cv">Uploading a CV</h3>
<p>In addition to the profile description, it is possible to upload a more extended CV as a PDF. To do so, click &quot;upload cv&quot; below your profile picture.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/upload_cv.png" title="upload a cv" alt="upload your cv" />
<p class="caption">upload your cv</p>
</div>
<!-- ### Degrees -->
<!-- You can also add your __degrees__ to your profile. Enter the name, the level, the dates and the institution of your degree and link it via the __relations-tab__ to projects, expositions or works that you created in support for your degree. -->
<h2 id="research-section">Research Section</h2>
<h3 id="grouping">Grouping</h3>
<p>When you create a new work or exposition the newly created objects appear in default groupings (&quot;Works&quot; and &quot;Expositions&quot;). By using the &quot;add grouping&quot; button you can create custom groupings. You can arrange objects according to freely created categories. To add a new group click &quot;add grouping&quot; and enter the name of the grouping. You can sort your objects within a group, arrange the groups themselves and move object between groups via drag and drop. Click and drag a grouping to change the order of the groups. On the right-hand side of a grouping's title, there are a series of icons displayed. Here you can edit and delete the grouping and control its public visibility (using the circle icon). Only custom grouping can be deleted. If you have only one grouping containing content, its title will not be shown on your public profile. Empty groups will also not be displayed on your public profile page.</p>
<h3 id="create-exposition">Create Exposition</h3>
<p>By clicking &quot;Create exposition&quot; you can create a new exposition object which will be opened in the RC exposition workspace editor. It is also possible to import expositions. Note that only expositions exported from the RC can be imported.</p>
<h3 id="add-work">Add Work</h3>
<p>A <strong>work</strong> in the RC can be used to represent self-sufficient artistic creations existing outside the RC, such as objects, compositions, recordings, videos, installations, paintings, photographs, books etc, but can also be used to represent events, presentations or expositions. You can add metadata such as the place of your work, the country or the material, technique or format. Moreover, the work can contain a collection of media files, which can later be accessed in used in expositions.</p>
<p>You can collaborate on works by inviting co-authors, contributors and supervisors. Moreover, you can relate works to other works and expositions by using the &quot;relations&quot;-tab in the &quot;edit details&quot;-dialogue window.</p>
<h3 id="add-project">Add Project</h3>
<p>A <strong>project</strong> is a container within which works or expositions may be produced. It is intended to represent academic research projects and degrees. Using the relations-tab, works or expositions can be linked to the project.</p>
<p>In case your project belongs to a degree, you can add ECTS-points.</p>
<h3 id="visibility-of-groupings">Visibility Of Groupings</h3>
<p>You can decide if you want a grouping to be visible in your public profile.</p>
<p>By default, new groupings are visible in your profile as soon as they contain an RC object. To hide groupings from your public profile click the small circle icon on the right hand side of the grouping's name. If the circle is thin, the grouping will not be shown on your public profile.</p>
<h3 id="open-exposition">Open Exposition</h3>
<p>The button &quot;open exposition&quot; opens the first page (or &quot;weave&quot;) of your exposition. This is equivalent to the <strong>preview</strong> version in the exposition workspace.</p>
<h3 id="exposition-details-menu">Exposition Details Menu</h3>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/hamburger_location.png" title="image showing location of menu button" alt="object menu location" />
<p class="caption">object menu location</p>
</div>
<p>To access the menu, click on the (&quot;hamburger&quot;) menu icon, located in the bottom right corner of an object (expositions or works). Some options are only available to the author of the object.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Change layout</strong> Change the size of an object on the profile.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Edit workspace</strong> Go to the workspace editor of this exposition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Edit details</strong> Change the meta data of your exposition, and control collaboration with other users.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Share</strong> Change who can see and access this item.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Self-publish</strong> Turn an exposition into a fixed state.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Add to shortcut</strong> Add a compact link to this object on the top of your list.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that publishing is a one-way action, once published one can not unpublish. If you want to keep the option of removing an exposition, do not use this option.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Submit for publication</strong> Submit an exposition to a portal for publication.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Add to shortcut</strong> Make a shortcut add the top of your profile.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Connect to portal</strong> Send a connection request to a portal.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Export</strong> Export an exposition as a tar.gz file (you can also use this to make a copy of an exposition, by importing the generated file)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Delete</strong> Delete an exposition or work from the RC.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="change-layout">Change Layout</h3>
<p>This dialogue gives you the option of choosing the size of an object in your profile.</p>
<p>Depending on the length of the content, the abstract and additional information may be reduced or even hidden. Sizing objects differently allows to focus a reader's attention to important objects as well as to improve the overall readability of your profile page.</p>
<p>Four layout-templates are possible:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>tall and across both columns</p></li>
<li><p>tall but only one column wide</p></li>
<li><p>short and only one column wide, the smalles possible size</p></li>
<li><p>short and across both columns</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="views">Views</h1>
<h2 id="exposition-view-or-preview">Exposition View or PREVIEW</h2>
<p>The exposition view is the final result that the reader will see when he/she opens your exposition, for example by opening the exposition URL or when a user clicks &quot;OPEN EXPOSITION&quot; anywhere on the RC.</p>
<p>While you are editing your exposition in the workspace editor, the PREVIEW button (right top corner) shows what the page will look like to the reader. If you already have a preview tab open, the second time you click PREVIEW, it will simply refresh, instead of opening a new tab.</p>
<!-- THIS SHOULD BE IN VIDEO AND AUDIO TOOLS ?
Note, that the video player, the audio player, the slideshow and object tool are only displayed fully in this PREVIEW view. 
-->
<p>While the EXPOSITION VIEW will always open the default entry page of your exposition, PREVIEW shows the page (or &quot;weave&quot;) that you currently are working on in your workspace. Thus, you can also PREVIEW pages that are not yet listed in the table of contents.</p>
<h2 id="navigation-bar">Navigation bar</h2>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/navigation-bar.png" title="image showing the navigation bar" alt="the RC navigation bar" />
<p class="caption">the RC navigation bar</p>
</div>
<h3 id="content">Content</h3>
<p>This contains the table of contents. At the bottom of the list a link to your personal profile and that of your co-authors can be found. To change the elements of the content list, please see the help section on <a href="#table-of-content">table of contents</a>.</p>
<h3 id="navigation">Navigation</h3>
<p>Navigation is a (simplified) graphical map of all the exposition's content on the current weave. You can click on this map to jump to a certain location of the exposition page.</p>
<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>When you add a new research exposition, object or work, you can give them a short abstract, this is displayed under &quot;abstract&quot; in the menubar. <!-- C: are abstracts also available under work, does this make sense ? --></p>
<h3 id="title-meta">Title / Meta</h3>
<p>By moving the mouse pointer over your account-name and the title of your research, a little window with metadata will appear. The link (URL) of the current page is shown, including the current scrolling location. This URL can thus be used to generate the hyperlink for internal linking. You can also use this link to cite a specific location of an exposition in publications outside of the RC.</p>
<h3 id="reviewing">Reviewing</h3>
<p>Reviewing is connected to the note tool (the yellow &quot;post-it&quot; notes) and is intended for the communication between the author(s) and the reviewer during the reviewing-process. This option is no longer available once an exposition has been published.</p>
<p>There are a couple of functions available under this menu: hide notes (hide all notes) show open notes (show only notes that are open) show resolved notes (show the resolved notes) add new note (open a note tool) previous note (jump to previous note) next note (jump to next note)</p>
<h3 id="comments">Comments</h3>
<p>Shows the latest and previous comments on your exposition from the RC community. Note that only registered users can read and write comments.</p>
<h3 id="terms-of-use">Terms of use</h3>
<p>This displays the terms of use of this and any exposition on the RC as set by the Society for Artistic Research (SAR)</p>
<h2 id="workspace-view">Workspace View</h2>
<p>The workspace view is the exposition editor of the RC. This is where you and your collaborators create and organise the expositions' content. It is only available to the author, co-authors and contributers of the exposition.</p>
<p>Within the workspace view, one can enable one of these two subviews:</p>
<h3 id="note-view">Note view</h3>
<p>The note-view is to be used in conjunction with the note-tool of the RC. Notes are meant to be used to communicate between author and reviewers or supervisors and authors. The note-view displays a list of all the notes that are within an exposition. One can filter this list based on the author, assignee and depending on its status (resolved, unresolved). You can also change these parameters in this view.</p>
<h3 id="text-view">Text view</h3>
<p>The text-view displays the text content of your exposition. You can activate the text-view by clicking on the button on the view-options. You have the opportunity to show or hide changes. You can also sort the items and open the html-editor to directly edit the content in the text-view.</p>
<p>You can close both views by clicking on &quot;close note view&quot; or &quot;close text view&quot; in the top-right.</p>

<h3 id="defaults">Defaults</h3>
<p>Defaults for styling and options can be set for a tool, by double clicking it in the toolbar.</p>
<h2 id="text-tool">Text Tool</h2>
<p>A video tutorial about the text tool is found <a href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/273532/273533/0/937" title="link to video tutorials">here</a></p>
<p>The text tool is designed for quickly adding text.</p>
<p>It has two states: when it is in <em>active state</em> you can change the text, if you click outside of the tool, you can move the object and change the size of the outer box. Double click inside of the tool to start editing the text again. Content is saved as soon as you exit the text editing state.</p>
<p>If you right click the text tool, you can find some extra edit options under <strong>edit</strong>. You can also (while hovering over a text tool with your mouse) click the (&quot;hamburger&quot;) menu icon and choose <strong>edit</strong>.</p>
<p>In comparison to the HTML-tool, the text tool allows you to edit your text directly on the page. While the HTML-tool opens a new dialog window. If you need more styling options, use the HTML-tool. A text tool can be converted to an HTML-tool via the menu option <strong>convert to HTML tool</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="options">Options</h3>
<p>If a text is longer than its frame on the weave, a scrollbar is generated automatically. You can control the visibility of the scrollbar in <strong>options</strong>. The default setting is <em>automatic</em>.</p>
<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>See <a href="#history">history</a>.</p>
<h2 id="html-tool">HTML-Tool</h2>
<p>The HTML-tool is designed for advanced text editing. It is a <em>what-you-see-is-what-you-get</em> rich text editor. Unlike the text tool, you can only edit its content in a dialog box.</p>
<h3 id="media">Media</h3>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/html-tool.png" title="an image showing the html media tab" alt="html tool media tab" />
<p class="caption">html tool media tab</p>
</div>
<p>Text is edited in the <strong>media</strong> tab. To preformat the text, choose your settings before typing. The style can also be edited after typing by selecting either the whole page or sections of the page and changing the formatting options as required.</p>
<p><em>! important: If you copy-paste your text from Word, Pages, LibreOffice, Google Docs or any other text editor, note that not all fonts are available on every computer. Only the fonts that are listed in the RC editor will be rendered correctly for all readers (even if they do not have the font installed on their computer). A better practice is to import the text without any formatting.</em></p>
<p>You can choose standard type formats such as bold, italic, or underline and adjust the text alignment, font, and size.</p>
<p>To enlarge the palette of text styling options, click on the first button, <strong>show/hide toolbars</strong>. Here you will find different options for further formating options, such as listings, enumerations, citations. It is also possible to create hyperlinks (using the chain symbol), or to set anchors for navigation. If you hover over an icon you can get a short text description of the function. The top right button opens the editor in fullscreen.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/html-tool-bar-extended.png" alt="html extended tool options" />
<p class="caption">html extended tool options</p>
</div>
<p>You can add pictures or further HTML materials such as i-frames (the embedding of HTML pictures or video is not possible with uploaded audio-visual content, which means that you have to publish a URL from an external server to paste it into the dialog). You can also choose the colour or the background of the text using the colour tools, insert symbols and tables, and control the edits with the <strong>show changes</strong> option.</p>
<h3 id="style-1">Style</h3>
<p><a href="#style-options">&gt; See style options</a></p>
<h3 id="options-1">Options</h3>
<p>If a text is longer than its frame on the weave, a scrollbar is generated automatically. You can control the visibility of the scrollbar in <strong>options</strong>. The default setting is <em>automatic</em>.</p>
<h3 id="templates">Templates</h3>
<p>If you want to reuse the content of an HTML-tool, you can create your own templates. This function can be found in the <strong>media</strong> tab. After finishing the edit of your template, click <strong>save</strong> <strong>as</strong> <strong>new</strong> <strong>template</strong> and give the template a name in the dialog box that appears. To load a template, click <strong>load template</strong> and choose one from the list in the dialog box.</p>
<h3 id="submit-delete-or-cancel">Submit, Delete, Or Cancel</h3>
<p>Finally, you need to exit the dialog window. If everything is the way you want it, choose <strong>submit</strong> and the text field will be loaded on the weave. To discard changes to the content, cancel the dialog box. If you want to delete the whole HTML field, including all content in it, click <strong>delete</strong>. Unintended deletions can be restored via <strong>commands</strong> – <strong>restore deleted tools</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="picture-tool">Picture Tool</h2>
<p>To add a picture, drag and drop the <strong>picture</strong> icon from the tool palette onto the weave. As with all other tools, a pop-up dialog appears automatically and gives you the choice between &quot;selecting&quot; or &quot;adding&quot; an item.</p>
<p>You can upload image files in the following formats: <em>jpg, png, tiff, gif, psd, tga, bmp.</em> For uploading PDFs, please use the PDF-tool.</p>
<p>To add an item, choose &quot;add&quot; and upload the object from your desktop to the RC servers. Name the file and make a declaration of the copyright holder. Once an image is uploaded it is also automatically added to the simple media tab.</p>
<h3 id="style-2">Style</h3>
<p><a href="#style-options">&gt; see style options</a></p>
<h3 id="options-2">Options</h3>
<p>There are different options concerning the properties of a picture and its position in relation to other objects. In the &quot;position&quot; menu in &quot;options,&quot; you can specify how the picture relates to other objects: choose between contain, cover, fit, and auto. <em>contain</em> is the default for this field. You also have the option to define the position of the picture in the picture frame (which is not visible in the browser unless you give it a specific style). The position is preset to <em>centre-centre</em>.</p>
<p>In <strong>settings</strong> you are able to lock the aspect ratio (the ratio of width to height), and you can allow readers to enlarge the image by activating the checkbox &quot;on click open image in popup.&quot; If you want to use a picture as a hyperlink, paste a URL into the field <em>on click open link</em>. It is also possible to show specific text when the cursor is moved over a picture. Please note, you can't change the copyright information in the &quot;edit picture&quot; window. To change the name or the copyright text, go to the item in <strong>simple media</strong> and click <strong>edit</strong> (also double click) to open the <strong>edit media</strong> dialog.</p>
<h2 id="audio-tool">Audio Tool</h2>
<p>As with the other tools, use the audio tool by dragging and dropping the icon from the tool palette onto the weave. A pop-up dialog window appears automatically and gives you the choice between &quot;selecting&quot; or &quot;adding&quot; an item.</p>
<p>You can upload audio files in the following formats: <em>ogg, wav, mov, au, mp4 audio container formats; mp2, mp3, aac, pcm a-law, flac audio codec</em> formats. All audio file formats will be transcoded to mp3s with 256kpbs.</p>
<p>To select media they must first have been uploaded into &quot;simple media.&quot; To add an item, choose &quot;add&quot; and upload the object from your desktop to the RC servers. Name the file and make a declaration of the copyright holder. After adding the file, you can edit the style of the audio player with the html style standards and choose between different play and display options.</p>
<p>Please note, to be used on our server, all media will be transcoded by the RC. This takes some time. During the transcoding process, the file name is greyed out in simple media. After the transcoding process has been finished you will receive an email notification that your media is transcoded and ready for use. For further information and technical questions see <a href="http://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/faq" title="FAQ">FAQ 2.6</a> or contact the RC User Support.</p>

<li><p><strong>loop</strong> Will loop the playback when it reaches the end of the file.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>autoplay</strong> The player starts to play back the file as soon as the page has been loaded.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>stop other players</strong> If you are using multiple audio (or video) players on the same weave and your page is quite big, visitors may find it helpful if you prevent overlapping by defining which player is playing. With this option selected, all players (video player, audio player on slideshows, other audio players) will stop when the selected player is playing back a file. When simultaneous playback is desired, it may be helpful to use the <a href="#play-tool" title="jump to play tool help">Play-tool</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>display minimal</strong> When selected, the player consists of only the play button and bar. You can also define some visual player settings. You can hide the whole menu bar or you can set the visibility of the volume or define if you want a player with as few options as possible.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As in the picture tool, if it is necessary to give textual information about the sound file, you can enter the text to be displayed when the mouse cursor hovers over the item.</p>
<h2 id="video-tool">Video Tool</h2>
<p>As with the other tools, you can use the video tool by dragging it from the tool palette and dropping it onto the weave.</p>
<p>In the dialog box that appears you have the possibility to add (i.e. upload) items from your computer or select items from the &quot;simple media&quot; folder. At the moment, the RC supports the following formats: <em>avi, mov, mp4, mpg</em> video container formats; <em>dv1394, h.264, mpeg2, mpeg1, mjepeg</em> video codec formats.</p>
<p>Please note also our general format information in <a href="http://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/faq" title="FAQ">FAQ 2.5</a>.</p>
<p>To add an item, choose &quot;add&quot; and upload the file from your desktop to the RC servers. All videos uploaded in this way will also be added to the simple media tab. Name the file and make a declaration of the copyright holder. After adding media, you can edit the style of the audio player with the html style standards and choose between different play and display options.</p>
<p>Please note, all media will be compressed to a smaller size, this is called 'transcoding'. This process takes time. During the 'transcoding' the file name is greyed out in your simple media. After the transcoding process is finished you will receive an email notification to tell you that your media is transcoded and ready for use. For further information and technical questions see <a href="http://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/faq" title="FAQ">FAQ 2.6</a> or contact the RC User Support.</p>
<p>We highly recommend using smaller video files. People without a fast internet connection will not watch videos when they are too big to stream fluently. If your file is extremely large, you may want to convert it using Handbrake, FFMpeg or another video compression tool to reduce its size.</p>
<h3 id="style-4">Style</h3>
<p><a href="#style-options">&gt; see style options</a></p>
<h3 id="options-4">Options</h3>
<p>The video player has a number of options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>loop</strong> Loops the video when it reaches the end.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>autoplay</strong> The player starts to playback the file when the page is loaded.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>stop other players</strong> If you are using multiple video players on the same weave and your page is quite big, visitors may find it helpful if you prevent overlapping by defining which player is playing. With this option selected, all players (video player, audio player on slideshows, other audio players) will stop when the selected player is running a file. When simultaneous playback is desired, it may be helpful to use the <a href="#play-tool" title="jump to play tool help">Play-tool</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>display minimal</strong> When selected, the player constists of only the play button and the bar.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As in the picture tool, if it is necessary to provide textual information on the video file you can choose to display plain text or copyright information that will appear when the mouse cursor hovers over the item.</p>
<p>You can also use the play tool to synchronize selected video and audio tools.</p>
<h2 id="slideshow-tool">Slideshow Tool</h2>
<p>The slideshow tool allows you to create a gallery of images that can be displayed in a loop. You can choose to start the slideshow automatically and you can add an audio file to each picture of the slideshow.</p>
<p>Drag and drop the slideshow icon onto the weave and the dialog window will appear.</p>
<p>To be able to select media you first have to upload an item into <strong>simple media</strong> or select media files from your works. To add an item, choose <strong>add</strong> and upload the object from your desktop to the RC servers. Name the file and make a declaration of the copyright holder. After adding the file, you can edit the style of the picture with the html style standards. To add a sound file to the slide, the file first needs to be uploaded to simple media.</p>
<h3 id="style-5">Style</h3>
<p><a href="#style-options">&gt; see style options</a></p>
<h3 id="options-5">Options</h3>
<p>In &quot;options&quot; you can define the position of the image within the frame. This is important when you are using images with different sizes and proportions. In <strong>settings</strong> it is possible to choose to loop the slideshow. If the <strong>loop</strong> option is enable, the slideshow will continue with the first slide once it reaches its last slide. You can choose to hide the navigation bar or give the reader the option to enlarge the picture with a click on the picture in your weave.</p>
<p>In <strong>automate</strong> you can set the autoplay options to:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>run after click</em> : run automatically after the first click</li>
<li><em>autoplay</em> : after loading the page</li>
</ul>
<p>When choosing <em>autoplay</em> you need to define the speed with which the slide will change. You can customise the duration of each slide (<em>speed per slide</em>) or let each slide change at the default speed.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, you can append audio files to each slide. Please note, you first have to upload the file into your <strong>simple media</strong> folder. In <strong>options</strong>, <strong>audio</strong> you can control the time of a crossfade (when one audio file fades out while a second fades in at a specified time). You can also choose the fade duration and the timeout of an audio file.</p>
<h2 id="pdf-tool">PDF Tool</h2>
<p>The PDF tools give you the possibility to include longer text documents in an RC exposition. It is generally preferable to use the text or HTML-tool for text.</p>
<p>After dragging the icon to the weave, you can upload the pdf in the &quot;edit pdf&quot; dialog window. You can also choose a pdf from &quot;simple media&quot; if it has been uploaded previously. An alternative way to upload is to click the &quot;+&quot; below &quot;simple media.&quot;</p>
<p>In the uploading dialog box, you can choose to represent the pdf in your exposition either with a preview image of the file or with a different picture.</p>
<p><a href="#style-options">&gt; see style options</a></p>
<h3 id="options-6">Options</h3>
<p>The RC gives you and your reader the possibility to read the pdf directly in the browser if the browser supports this. To use this option check &quot;display in browser&quot; in option &gt; settings of the &quot;edit pdf&quot; tool dialog box. As in the picture tool, you can provide further information using the hover option. To do this, select one of the options in the &quot;show on hover&quot; pull-down menu. In addition, you can create a plain text to be displayed when the reader's mouse hovers over the PDF preview. To use this, choose &quot;plain text&quot; or &quot;copyright &amp; plain text&quot; from the pull-down menu and write your text in the text field below.</p>
<h2 id="play-tool">Play Tool</h2>
<p>The play tool is designed to synchronize the playback of selected video and audio tools on the same weave. With this tool one can create a single control for playing back various media files at the same time. This can, for example, be used to document video installations with multiple screens and allows playing back synchronized combinations of musical voices and audio tracks. The play tool displays an image which can be clicked and functions as play and pause button. Clicking the image will start the playback of the selected audio and video files. While playing the tool another image will be displayed instead. Clicking this image will pause the players.</p>
<h3 id="media-1">Media</h3>
<p>In the media tab one can upload two image files. One image will be the play­placeholder, i.e.clicking the image will initiate the playback of the selected files. The other image will be the pause­placeholder, i.e. clicking this image will pause the selected audio and video files on the weave.</p>
<h3 id="options-7">Options</h3>
<p>In the options tab one can select from among all audio and video files on the weave. These must have been uploaded first with the audio and video tools. The selected files will be controlled with the play tool. The option “pause other players when playing” will ensure that only the selected media files will be played back.</p>
<h2 id="shape-tool">Shape Tool</h2>
<p>The Shape tool is designed for placing simple graphic elements such as arrows and lines in your exposition. You can generate forms to structure your layout or to help navigation. You can create rectangles, circles and lines. You can choose if they're filled or not. You also have the possibility to specify the thickness of the frame and control the opacity of the elements. There are also four types of arrows (left, right, up, down). You can resize the elements on the weave by resizing the green frame displayed around the shape. By clicking and dragging the yellow point you can rotate an element.</p>
<h2 id="note-tool">Note Tool</h2>
<p>The note tool allows you to organize your work on RC, comment on sections, and communicate with co-authors. Drag the note icon from the tool-pallett onto the weave. You can write directly into the note without opening a new edit-window. Each note has a time-stamp which is generated when the note is placed on the weave.</p>
<p>It is possible to define who is responsible for the content (a change or revision, correction) of the note and you can set a date for resolving the issue described in the note.</p>
<p>Notes are visible on the preview as well. Please check, that all notes have been removed from the exposition when you intend to share or publish it.</p>
<h3 id="text-style-options">Text Style Options</h3>
<p>You can use the buttons to directly add the basic stylings, eg. highlight it with bold or italic font or structure it with numerations or lists. You can change the font-family and increase or decrease the indentation. You can also insert links.</p>
<h3 id="history-1">History</h3>
<p>&quot;History&quot; provides a log of all changes that have been made to the tool. If you have unintentionally deleted a tool, you can restore it using &quot;restore deleted tools&quot; in the commands.</p>
<h2 id="object-viewer">Object Viewer</h2>
<p>The object viewer tool is a designed for displaying three-dimensional images. Is is based on the <a href="http://thoro.de/page/3dnp-introduction-en" title="3dnp">3DNP library</a>. By dragging the object with the mouse cursor it can rotated around two axis, i.e. the object can be turned around its centre and tilted back and forth. It is necessary to upload a series of images as a zip file. These images need to be numbered (i.e. image001.jpg, image002.jpg etc). Each image must the object from a different angle. You can imagine the creation of the images as the following process: the object rotates around a vertical axis in a number of steps, then moving slightly around a horizontal axis and rotating around the vertical axis in a number of steps again. This is repeated until an image of every combination of vertical and horizontal positions has been created. The number of different angles (steps of rotation around the horizontal axis) is defined by the setting &quot;levels&quot; in the dialog window. The number of steps of the rotation around the vertical axis is implicitly defined by &quot;levels&quot; and the total number of images.</p>
<h2 id="style-options">Style Options</h2>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/style-tab.png" title="the style tab of an html tool" alt="image showing the style tab of an html tool" />
<p class="caption">image showing the style tab of an html tool</p>
</div>
<p>The style tab allows you to set the way an object looks on the outside. Click on the small &quot;&gt;&quot; to open one of these sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>position &amp; rotation</li>
<li>padding</li>
<li>border type, color and width</li>
<li>background (color or image)</li>
<li>shadow</li>
<li>opacity</li>
</ul>
<p>The style tab only sets the basic (mostly external) style of the object, text markup is done within the text or html tools.</p>
<h3 id="change-tool-defaults">Change tool defaults</h3>
<p>It is possible to change the default styling settings for any tool, by double clicking the tool in the toolbar. After the default is changed, every newly created tool will initially use these new settings.</p>
<h2 id="history-2">History</h2>
<p>The <em>history tab</em> gives you the posibility to change the content <strong>within the tool</strong> to an older version. The versions of a text object are created each time you have clicked outside it (and the three animated dots show inside). With the html tool, a version is created each time you click submit.</p>
<h1 id="commands">Commands</h1>
<p>The commands tab displayed in the workspace editor contains extra functions and settings for use in the workspace editor.</p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The overview displays a small window on the right hand side of the editor. It is useful for navigation on the weave while editing. It also shows objects that might otherwise be invisible. It will not be part of your exposition in the preview. In the final presentation of your exposition there is another navigation window in the menubar, which is similar to the overview.</p>
<p>Under the overview map there is a list of all the tools (called layers) that are currently present in the presentation. When you click on one, the editor automatically scrolls to that tool. You can edit, lock or delete a tool with the buttons below the list.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>tip</em>: A tool will not scroll into view if it has a negative position (outside of your canvas). You can still change the position by clicking the edit button at the bottom of the view. *</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="snap-to-grid-grid-size-invisible-grid">Snap to Grid / Grid Size / Invisible Grid</h3>
<p>Objects can be aligned to a grid. By default, the grid size is set to 5x5 pixels. You can change the size of the grid by clicking the pull-down-menu and choosing one of the options from the list. You can also remove the grid by selecting 'invisible' from the same list. With &quot;snap to grid&quot; you activate objects will be placed according to the grid.</p>
<h3 id="set-default-position-show-current-position">Set Default Position/ Show Current Position</h3>
<p>A rather unique feature of the RC is the absolute positioning of items on the weave. This makes it possible to position by pixels allowing for and open very free process of designing and navigating and linking to specific positions on the weave.</p>
<p>By using <em>set default position</em> you can set the entry position of your page (which is 0;0 top/left by default) to any other position of the weave. Scroll to the position you want readers to first when opening your exposition and click &quot;set default position&quot;.</p>
<p>You may want to link to a special position on the weave and you have to generate the URL for this. After browsing to the coordinates or to the item you can generate the URL by clicking &quot;show current position&quot;. You can copy the URL and use it for hyperlinking, anchoring or for publishing.</p>
<h3 id="restore-deleted-tools">Restore Deleted Tools</h3>
<p>Every tool or item on the weave can be deleted by using the right-click (or by using the menu-icon) and selecting the delete function.</p>
<p>It is possible to restore a tool. Because the RC runs within a browser, you can't use the undo function of your browser or the shortcut on your keyboard. Every item has its own history which is listed in the &quot;history&quot;-tab in the edit-tool-dialog. Here you have the option restore previous states of the object. If the object has been deleted and is no longer directly accessible and can be restored deleted using the &quot;restore deleted tools&quot; command. After clicking it, a list of deleted tool appears.</p>
<h3 id="send-collaboration-message">Send Collaboration Message</h3>
<p>When you are collaborating on an exposition, you can use the command &quot;send collaboration message&quot; to commuicate with the co-authors or contributors. Open the command by clicking on the button and you will find a message-window. In the upper part you can choose the partners you want to contact. Select them by clicking on the &quot;+&quot;-icon behind their names. Below you find a html-based message window. Here you can enter the message.</p>

<h1 id="navigation-1">Navigation</h1>
<h3 id="menu-bar-navigation">Menu Bar Navigation</h3>
<p>When one moves the mouse cursor to the top of an exposition a menu bar appears. The menu bar displays the title of the exposition and the name of its author as well as a series of drop down menus, which allow one to navigate the current page (or &quot;weave&quot;) and the exposition as a whole. The first item (&quot;home&quot;) opens the table of content, which can be freely designed by the author (see the next section on how to enter entries into the table of content). The second item (&quot;navigation&quot;) displays a schematic overview of the current page. It outlines all tools on the page, their size and position. By moving the red rectangle, which displays the currently visible part of the weave, one can navigate the page and alter the current selection.</p>
<h3 id="table-of-content">Table of Content</h3>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/273532/273533/54/759">video tutorial</a> on this topic.</p>
<p>The table of content is designed to facilitate the navigation through an exposition. In order to edit the table of content and enter entries click on the title of your exposition in the editor (one can also open this window by going to the exposition on the profile page and clicking &quot;edit details&quot;). This opens a dialogue window titled &quot;Edit Research.&quot; The second tab (&quot;table of content&quot;) of this window contains a series of entries. To make a new entry select the page (or &quot;weave&quot;) that this item in the table of content is supposed to link to from the pull down menu and enter a title for this entry to be displayed in the table of content. Moreover one can choose a specific position within the selected page. The &quot;X-Coord&quot; is the distance in pixels from the left margin of the exposition and the &quot;Y-Coord&quot; is the distance in pixels from the top margin (See the section on &quot;Commands&quot; for more information on obtaining position information.) The table of content thus not only allows structuring expositions by creating a series of weaves, but also by using various locations within one weave.</p>
<h3 id="hyperlinking">Hyperlinking</h3>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/273532/273533">video tutorial</a> on this topic.</p>
<p>It is possible to create hyperlinks between pages (or &quot;weaves&quot;) of an exposition and within a single page. In order to create a link to a different page, select the target weave in the editor. Select the tab &quot;Commands&quot; on the right hand side and click on &quot;show current position.&quot; This will display the URL of the target page. Copy the URL into the clipboard (Ctrl-C/Cmd-C). Move the page where you want to create the link. Create an HTML-Tool (see the section on the HTML-Tool for more information) and enter the text to be displayed and selected it. By right-clicking open the context menu and select &quot;Insert/Edit Link,&quot; paste the copied URL into the text field labeled &quot;Link URL&quot; and close the HTML-Tool by clicking &quot;Submit.&quot; One can also create a link to a different position within the same page by moving to this position (see also the next section on the overview function) and following the same procedure. ### Overview</p>
<p>Within the &quot;Commands&quot; tab on the right-hand side of the editor there is a checkbox labeled &quot;Overview.&quot; Clicking the checkbox will open andclose an a schematic overview on the right-hand side of theeditor. The overview outlines all tools on the page, their size andposition. By moving the red rectangle, which displays the currentlyvisible part of the weave, one can navigate the page and alter thecurrent selection.</p>
<!-- TODO: Insert links to other parts of the documentation -->
<h1 id="publishing-and-sharing">Publishing and Sharing</h1>
<p>There are number of different ways to share and publish your work on the RC. This functionality can be accessed using the object menu (i.e. clicking the menu icon) for the given work or exposition on the &quot;My Profile&quot;-page.</p>
<h3 id="share">Share</h3>
<p>Works and expositions can be shared. They can be made public (visible to anyone on the internet), private, or visible to RC users only. As long as the object has not been published it remains editable.</p>
<h3 id="self-publish">Self-Publish</h3>
<p>Self-publishing makes an exposition no longer editable and publicly visible.</p>
<h3 id="submit-for-publication">Submit for Publication</h3>
<p>Expositions can be submitted to portals (such as journals) for publication. Click &quot;submit unlimited publication to&quot; and select the portal. While the exposition is in review it can no longer be edited. The portal admin or editor will contact you regarding the reviewing process.</p>
<h3 id="connect-to-portal">Connect to Portal</h3>
<p>A work or exposition can be connected to a portal without being published by the portal. The portal admin will receive a notification and has to confirm the connection. Once the connection has been approved it will be shown in the object's metadata and the object may appear on the portal page and portal feeds. Connected works may for example accompany a published exposition or represent a connected event.</p>
<h1 id="follow-and-search">Follow and Search</h1>
<h3 id="follow">Follow</h3>
<p>It is possible to &quot;follow&quot; other users, portals, and objects such as expositions and works. Once you are logged in you will see &quot;follow&quot; links in the bottom right corner of objects displayed on the front page, other user's pages and other places on the RC. &quot;Follow&quot; links also appear on user and portal profile pages. Once you follow a user, portal, or object new publications, edits, comments etc. will be displayed on the &quot;FEEDS&quot; page. Clicking the wrench icon opens up a dialog in which you can adjust the precise information you want to see for each user, portal or object you follow.</p>
<h3 id="search">Search</h3>
<p>You can search the RC by using the search field in the top right corner. Moreover you can use the &quot;advanced search&quot; functionality, which allows for filtered searches and and searches according to specific criteria such as object type, keywords, authors, etc.</p>
<h1 id="collaborating-on-research">Collaborating on Research</h1>
<p>The Research Catalogue allows you to collaborate on a research exposition with multiple users. An author of an exposition can invite collaborators through the collaboration tab of the exposition: click the menu icon (1) and 'edit details' (2) next to the research on your profile (or click on the name of your exposition in the exposition workspace), choose 'collaboration', search for the user you want to cooperate with and add her or him by clicking on their name. The users that were added will show up as a list below the field. After clicking submit, collaborators will receive an invitation from you in their message-box which they can accept or decline. When accepting the invitation, the collaborator will have access to your exposition workspace and he will be able to edit it.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/collaborate_1.png" title="Collaborate Image showing the menu icon" alt="Collaborate Image showing the menu icon" />
<p class="caption">Collaborate Image showing the menu icon</p>
</div>
<h3 id="removing-a-collaborator">Removing a Collaborator</h3>
<p>If you want to remove a collaborator, click the &quot;x&quot; behind their name in the field they were added. If you remove a supervisor, the supervisor will receive a requist to remove them.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/collaborate_2.png" title="Collaboration tab" alt="Collaboration tab" />
<p class="caption">Collaboration tab</p>
</div>
<p>Note: If a users name in the list is enclosed in brackets ( [ name ] ), it means that the invitation is sent successfully, but has not been accepted yet by the receiver.</p>
<p>There are 3 types of collaborators :</p>
<ul>
<li><em>co-author</em> the collaborator is considered a co-author of the research and will be presented in the author list of the research exposition</li>
<li><em>contributor</em> this type of collaborator has the same rights but won't feature as co-author of your exposition. An example of a contributor might be a 'graphical designer' helping with the layout of your exposition without having any involvement with the research itself.</li>
<li><em>supervisor</em> can view an exposition and leave comments. The supervisor will also be mentioned in the metadata.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="communication-with-collaborators">Communication with Collaborators</h3>
<p>While collaborating on an exposition, there are several ways of communicating with each other</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Using the note tool</strong> Notes are the RC equivalent of yellow post it notes. You can simply drag one from the toolbar onto the exposition workspace. See also the note tool help.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Send collaboration message</strong> You can send a direct text message to your collaborator using the <em>Send collaboration message</em> found under the <strong>commands</strong>_ tab.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Posting a comment</strong> In expositions where you are not a collaborator, you can still leave comments by going to the top bar of the exposition and clicking the <strong>Comments</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="footnotes-and-popovers">Footnotes and Popovers</h1>
<p>It is possible to create footnotes and popover weaves in the text, HTML and picture tools. The terms &quot;footnote&quot; and &quot;popover&quot; are used almost interchangeably here. Footnote, however, refers rather to the textual concept of a footnote, i.e. a particular use of the functionality explained in this section, whereas popover is used when referring specifically to the appearing popover window. (There is a tutorial video explaining the footnote workflow on the <a href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/273532/273533">RC Video Tutorials page</a>) These are displayed when the RC user reading the exposition clicks the footnote link or, depending on the settings, when he or she mouse the mouse pointer over the link. This functionality makes it possible to create footnotes in texts, but also create popovers of any size containing RC objects of any type. There are a number of different ways of creating footnotes.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-simple-text-footnote">Creating a Simple Text Footnote</h3>
<p>In order to create a footnote in the text or HTML tool one selects some text, which will be the footnote link and clicks the &quot;Insert/Edit Link or Footnote&quot; menu item (see image).</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/footnotes_sel.png" alt="Selecting text as a footnote link" />
<p class="caption">Selecting text as a footnote link</p>
</div>
<p>A new footnote can be create by using the left tab in the appearing dialog window. In this window one can set:</p>
<ul>
<li>The title of the footnote.</li>
<li>Whether the popover will be shown when the link is clicked or on mouseover (&quot;View on&quot;).</li>
<li>Where the popover will be displayed with reference to the link or the screen in case of the last option (&quot;screen center&quot;).</li>
<li>Whether the background (i.e. the rest of the exposition) will be darkened when the popover is being shown.</li>
<li>The type of the popover. This can be:</li>
<li>A new popover.</li>
<li>The copy of an existing popover.</li>
<li>A simple text popover. A small text box appears which facilitates the creation of footnotes and other popovers containing only a short amount of text. The text can be entered here directly upon creation without the need to further edit the popover and adjust its size. <img src="images/footnote_dia.png" alt="Footnote dialog window" /></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, click &quot;Add Footnote&quot; to confirm and create the footnote, which will subsequently appear in the list of footnotes on the left side of the screen.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/footnote_preview.png" alt="Preview of a footnote" />
<p class="caption">Preview of a footnote</p>
</div>
<h3 id="editing-a-footnote">Editing a Footnote</h3>
<p>All footnotes are listed in the &quot;Footnotes&quot; tab on the left hand side.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/footnotes_list.png" alt="List of footnotes" />
<p class="caption">List of footnotes</p>
</div>
<p>There are three icons displayed to the right of the title of each footnote. The first icon opens a window which allows editing the title, size, and styling of the footnote. The second icon (the wrench) opens up the footnote in the weave editor. Here one can edit the footnote just like any other weave. One can leave the footnote weave editor by clicking the link &quot;back to main weave&quot; displayed to the left of the main tab. (see image).</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/footnote_back.png" alt="Back to main weave link" />
<p class="caption">Back to main weave link</p>
</div>
<h3 id="auto-numbered-footnotes">Auto-Numbered Footnotes</h3>
<p>Instead of using text as footnote links it is also possible to use numbered links. The numbers will be filled in and adjusted automatically. In order to create auto-numbered footnotes create a footnote in the text or HTML tool as described above but without selecting any text. An &quot;x&quot; will be inserted where the cursor is placed. This &quot;x&quot; will be replaced by the correct number when the text is displayed.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/footnote_auto.png" alt="Auto-numbered footnote in the editor" />
<p class="caption">Auto-numbered footnote in the editor</p>
</div>
<p>The numbering starts at 1 and encompasses all text and HTML objects on the weave. Numbering is performed by object and proceeds from the top and left to the bottom and right of the page.</p>
<h3 id="pictures">Pictures</h3>
<p>It is also possible to use images as links to footnotes. When clicking on the image or moving over it with the mouse cursor the popover will be show.

<h3 id="unpublishing-an-exposition">Unpublishing an exposition</h3>
<p>The unpublishing of expositions is not encuraged. Published expositions are supposed to be a permament reference, never to be deleted or changed. If an exposition is to be continuously changed or temporary, it is better to not publish, but simply set its sharing settings to <strong>public</strong>. When unpublishing an exposition make sure with the author of the exposition that there are no connected works that have been deleted since, otherwise it may be impossible to reconstruct the publication.</p>
<h2 id="connection-requests">Connection Requests</h2>
<p>It is possible for users to connect a work or exposition to a portal. The works that have been accepted by an admin of the portal will be listed here. Requests can simply be accepted <strong>V</strong> or rejected <strong>X</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="reviewing-1">Reviewing</h2>
<p>The reviewing page allows managment of expositions that have been applied for publication by the author. Reviewers can be assigned to these works. There are two styles of reviewing: single blind or double blind. Single blind means that the author cannot see the reviewers. Double blind means that the reviewers cannot see each other.</p>
<p>Please note that within the KonCon portal, supervisor notes can be seen by reviewers.</p>

<p><img src="images/edit-publish-collaboration.png" title="image showing edit collaborators dialog" alt="reviewing edit collaboration dialog" />;</p>

<tr class="header">
<th>Publish</th>
