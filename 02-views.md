## Exposition View or PREVIEW

The exposition view is the final result that the reader will see when he/she opens your exposition, for example by opening the exposition URL [https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/13747/145889/78/0](https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/13747/145889/78/0) or when a user clicks "OPEN EXPOSITION" anywhere on the RC.

While you are editing your exposition, the PREVIEW button (right top corner) shows what the page will look like to the reader. If you already have a preview tab open, the second time you click PREVIEW, it will simply refresh, instead of opening a new tab. 

<!-- THIS SHOULD BE IN VIDEO AND AUDIO TOOLS ?
Note, that the video player, the audio player, the slideshow and object tool are only displayed fully in this PREVIEW view. 
-->

Although the EXPOSITION VIEW will always open the default page, PREVIEW shows the page that you currently are working on in your workspace. Thus, you can also PREVIEW pages that are not yet listed in the table of contents.

### Content
This contains the table of contents.  At the bottom of the list a link to your personal profile and that of your co-authors can be found.
To change the elements of the content list, please see the help section on [table of contents](#table-of-content).

### Navigation
Navigation is a (simplified) graphical map of all the exposition's content on the current weave. You can click on this map to jump to a certain location of the exposition page.

### Abstract
When you add a new research exposition, object or work, you can give them a short abstract, this is displayed under "abstract" in the menu-bar. 
<!-- C: are abstracts also available under work, does this make sense ? -->

### Title / meta
By moving the mouse pointer over your account-name and the title of your research, a little window with metadata will appear. The link (URL) of the current page is shown, including the current location where you are currently scrolled to. This URL can thus be used to generate the hyperlink for internal hyperlinking. You can also use this link to cite a specific location of an exposition in publications outside of the RC.

### Reviewing
Reviewing is connected with the note tool (the yellow post-its) and is made for the communication between the author(s) and the reviewer during the reviewing-process. This option is not available when the exposition is published.

There are a couple of functions available under this menu:
hide notes 				(hide all notes)
show open notes 		(show only notes that are open)
show resolved notes 	(show the resolved notes)
add new note 			(open a note tool)
previous note           (jump to previous note)
next note               (jump to next note)

### Comments
Shows the latest and previous comments to your exposition from the RC community. Note that only registered users can read and make comments. 

### Terms of use
Terms of use leeds you and your readers to the terms of use of this and any expositions on RC passed by the Society for Artistic Research (SAR)
 
## Workspace View

The workspace view is the editor of the RC. This is where you and your collaborators create and organise the expositions' content. It is only available to the author, co-authors and contributers of the exposition.

Within the workspace view, one can enable one of these two subviews:

### Note view
 
The note-view is to be used in conjunction with the note-tool of the RC. Notes are meant to be used to communicate between author and reviewers or supervisors and authors. The note-view displays a list of all the notes that are within an exposition. One can filter this list based on the author, assignee and weither it has been marked resolved. Also you can change these parameters in this view. 

### Text view

Sometimes it can be confusing to retrace all the changes in one or more text(s) while editing the exposition. The text-view shields the texts from the graphic and media-content from your exposition. You can activate the text-view by clicking on the button on the view-options. You have the opportunity to show or hide the changes of a text. You can also sort the items and open the html-editor to make changes directly in the text-view.
 
You can close both views by clicking on "close note view" or "close text view" top-right.
