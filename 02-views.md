## Exposition View or PREVIEW

The exposition view is the final result that the reader will see when
he/she opens your exposition, for example by opening the exposition
URL or when a user clicks "OPEN EXPOSITION" anywhere on the RC.

While you are editing your exposition in the workspace editor, the
PREVIEW button (right top corner) shows what the page will look like
to the reader. If you already have a preview tab open, the second time
you click PREVIEW, it will simply refresh, instead of opening a new
tab.

<!-- THIS SHOULD BE IN VIDEO AND AUDIO TOOLS ?
Note, that the video player, the audio player, the slideshow and object tool are only displayed fully in this PREVIEW view. 
-->

While the EXPOSITION VIEW will always open the default entry page
of your exposition, PREVIEW shows the page (or "weave") that you
currently are working on in your workspace. Thus, you can also PREVIEW
pages that are not yet listed in the table of contents.

### Content 

This contains the table of contents.  At the bottom of the list a link
to your personal profile and that of your co-authors can be found.  To
change the elements of the content list, please see the help section
on [table of contents](#table-of-content).

### Navigation

Navigation is a (simplified) graphical map of all the exposition's
content on the current weave. You can click on this map to jump to a
certain location of the exposition page.

### Abstract

When you add a new research exposition, object or work, you can give
them a short abstract, this is displayed under "abstract" in the
menubar.
<!-- C: are abstracts also available under work, does this make sense ? -->

### Title / Meta

By moving the mouse pointer over your account-name and the title of
your research, a little window with metadata will appear. The link
(URL) of the current page is shown, including the current scrolling
location. This URL can thus be used to generate the hyperlink for
internal linking. You can also use this link to cite a specific
location of an exposition in publications outside of the RC.

### Reviewing

Reviewing is connected to the note tool (the yellow "post-it" notes)
and is intended for the communication between the author(s) and the
reviewer during the reviewing-process. This option is no longer
available once an exposition has been published.

There are a couple of functions available under this menu:
hide notes 				(hide all notes)
show open notes 		(show only notes that are open)
show resolved notes 	(show the resolved notes)
add new note 			(open a note tool)
previous note           (jump to previous note)
next note               (jump to next note)

### Comments

Shows the latest and previous comments on your exposition from the RC
community. Note that only registered users can read and write comments.

### Terms of use

This displays the terms of use of this and any exposition on the RC as
set by the Society for Artistic Research (SAR)
 
## Workspace View

The workspace view is the exposition editor of the RC. This is where
you and your collaborators create and organise the expositions'
content. It is only available to the author, co-authors and
contributers of the exposition.

Within the workspace view, one can enable one of these two subviews:

### Note view
 
The note-view is to be used in conjunction with the note-tool of the
RC. Notes are meant to be used to communicate between author and
reviewers or supervisors and authors. The note-view displays a list of
all the notes that are within an exposition. One can filter this list
based on the author, assignee and depending on its status (resolved,
unresolved). You can also change these parameters in this view.

### Text view

The text-view displays the text content of your exposition. You can
activate the text-view by clicking on the button on the
view-options. You have the opportunity to show or hide changes. You
can also sort the items and open the html-editor to directly edit the
content in the text-view.
 
You can close both views by clicking on "close note view" or "close
text view" in the top-right.
