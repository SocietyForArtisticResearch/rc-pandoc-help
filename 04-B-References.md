# References

The reference feature helps you build a bibliography for your exposition.
The RC currently supports the following types:

- Book
- Chapter (of a book)
- Journal (article)
- Website
- Master Thesis
- Phd Thesis
- Proceedings
- Video
- Score
- Artwork
- Recording
- Exposition
- Misc

Each item will have different fields. Fields marked with * are required.
In case none of the types fit, you may choose to use Misc, which stands for miscellaneous.

## Creating a reference

You can create a new reference by going to the Ref tab, which is located on the right-hand side of the workspace editor. 
Click the + button to create a new reference. A dialog will open with a form to enter the reference data.
