# Follow and Search

#### Follow 

It is possible to "follow" other users, portals, and objects such as
expositions and works.  Once you are logged in you will see "follow"
links in the bottom right corner of objects displayed on the front
page, other user's pages and other places on the RC. "Follow" links
also appear on user and portal profile pages. Once you follow a user,
portal, or object new publications, edits, comments etc. will be
displayed on the "FEEDS" page. Clicking the wrench icon opens up a
dialog in which you can adjust the precise information you want to see
for each user, portal or object you follow.

#### Search

You can search the RC by using the search field in the top right
corner. Moreover you can use the "advanced search" functionality,
which allows for filtered searches and and searches according to
specific criteria such as object type, keywords, authors, etc.
