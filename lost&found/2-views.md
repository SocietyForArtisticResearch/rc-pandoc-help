# Views

In the RC there are different ways of viewing the exposition. In general we can differ the workspace view and the preview in browser. The workspace view is only for you and your collaborators or co-authors and shows you all tools, all files you have uploaded and the way you structure and layout your work on one or more weaves in the framing of the editor. The preview is the way how people from the RC community or the web can see your research in there browsers. It necessary to test the preview in different browsers, because every browser has its own way to display the html-code from your side. 
 
## Preview

The PREVIEW shows what the page will look like to the reader. If you already have a preview tab open, the second time you click PREVIEW, it will refresh this previous tab. Note, that the video player, the audio player, the slideshow and object tool are only displayed fully in this PREVIEW view (once the audio or video file has been transcoded, at least). 

Preview shows always the tab (weave) that you are currently editing. This includes tabs that have not yet been entered in the table of contents.

What follows now is a description of the various options in the navigation bar of an exposition:

### Content
Within the preview you can open content to get the table of contents.  At the bottom of the list a link to your personal profile and that of your co-authors can be found.
To change the elements of the content list, please see the help section on [table of content](#table-of-content).

### Navigation
Navigation is a (simplified) graphical map of all the exposition's content on the current weave. You can click on this map to jump to a certain location of the exposition page.

### Abstract
When you add a new research exposition, object or work, you can give them a short abstract, this is displayed under "abstract" in the menu-bar. 
<!-- C: are abstracts also available under work, does this make sense ? -->

### Title / meta
By moving the mouse pointer over your account-name and the title of your research, a little window with metadata will appear. The link (URL) of the current page is shown, including the current location where you are currently scrolled to. This URL can thus be used to generate the hyperlink for internal hyperlinking. You can also use this link to cite a specific location of an exposition in publications outside of the RC.

### Reviewing
Reviewing is connected with the note tool and is made for the communication between the author(s) and the reviewer during the reviewing-process. This option is not available when the exposition is published.

### Comments
Shows the latest and previous comments to your exposition from the RC community.

### Terms of use
Terms of use leeds you and your readers to the terms of use of this and any expositions on RC passed by the Society for Artistic Research (SAR)
 
## Note view
 
The note-view is to be used in conjunction with the note-tool of the RC. It is only available in the workspace editor, not in preview. Notes are meant to be used as a means to communicate between author and reviewers or supervisors and authors. The note-view displays a list of all the notes that are within an exposition. One can filter this list based on the author, assignee and weither it has been marked resolved. Also you can change these parameters in this view. 

## Text view

Sometimes it can be confusing to retrace all the changes in one or more text(s) while editing the exposition. The text-view shields the texts from the graphic and media-content from your exposition. You can activate the text-view by clicking on the button on the view-options. You have the opportunity to show or hide the changes of a text. You can also sort the items and open the html-editor to make changes directly in the text-view.
 
You can close both views by clicking on "close note view" or "close text view" top-right.
