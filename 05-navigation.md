# Navigation

### Menu Bar Navigation

![menu bar](images/menu-bar-navigation.png)

When one moves the mouse cursor to the top of an exposition a menu bar
appears. The menu bar displays (from left to right):

* __Contents__, which can be freely designed by the author (see [table of content](#table-of-content)). In most expositions this contains a list of the pages.
* __Navigation__ displays a schematic map/overview of the current page. It outlines all used tools on the page, their size and position. By clicking inside the map, you can jump to another position on the page. Your current position within the exposition is shown as a red rectangle.
* __Abstract__ the abstract of this exposition
* __The title__ of the exposition and the name of its author(s). One can also hoover over this title to receive an exact link to this location on the page. 

### Table of Content

See the [video tutorial](https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/273532/273533/54/759) on this topic.

![Table of content dialog](images/table-of-content-dialog)

The table of content is designed to facilitate the navigation through
an exposition. In order to edit the table of content and enter entries
click on the title of your exposition in the editor (one can also open
this window by going to the exposition on the profile page and
clicking "edit details"). This opens a dialogue window titled "Edit
Research." The second tab ("table of content") of this window contains
a series of entries. To make a new entry select the page (or "weave")
that this item in the table of content is supposed to link to from the
pull down menu and enter a title for this entry to be displayed in the
table of content. Moreover one can choose a specific position within
the selected page. The "X-Coord" is the distance in pixels from the
left margin of the exposition and the "Y-Coord" is the distance in
pixels from the top margin (See the section on "Commands" for more
information on obtaining position information.) The table of content
thus not only allows structuring expositions by creating a series of
weaves, but also by using various locations within one weave.

### Hyperlinking

See the [video tutorial](https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/273532/273533) on this topic.

It is possible to create hyperlinks between pages (or "weaves") of an
exposition and within a single page. In order to create a link to a
different page, select the target weave in the editor. Select the tab
"Commands" on the right hand side and click on "show current
position." This will display the URL of the target page. Copy the URL
into the clipboard (Ctrl-C/Cmd-C). Move the page where you want to
create the link. Create an HTML-Tool (see the section on the HTML-Tool
for more information) and enter the text to be displayed and selected
it. By right-clicking open the context menu and select "Insert/Edit
Link," paste the copied URL into the text field labeled "Link URL" and
close the HTML-Tool by clicking "Submit." One can also create a link
to a different position within the same page by moving to this
position (see also the next section on the overview function) and
following the same procedure.  

### Overview

Within the "Commands" tab on the right-hand side of the editor there
is a checkbox labeled "Overview." Clicking the checkbox will open
andclose an a schematic overview on the right-hand side of
theeditor. The overview outlines all tools on the page, their size
andposition. By moving the red rectangle, which displays the
currentlyvisible part of the weave, one can navigate the page and
alter thecurrent selection.
