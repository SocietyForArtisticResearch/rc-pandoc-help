# Collaborating on Research

The Research Catalogue allows you to work together on a research exposition with multiple users. This is called collaboration.
  
There are 3 types of collaborators:
  
- *co-author* : the collaborator is considered a co-author of the research and will be presented in the author list of the research exposition 
- *contributor* : this type of collaborator has the same rights but won't feature as co-author of your exposition. An example of a contributor might be a graphical designer helping with the layout of your exposition without having any involvement with the research itself.
- *supervisor* : can view an exposition and leave comments. The supervisor will also be mentioned in the metadata.

### Adding a Collaborator

An author of an exposition can invite collaborators through the collaboration tab of the exposition: click
the __menu icon__ (1) and __'edit details'__ (2) next to the research on your profile. If you are already in the workspace editor, you can also click on the title of your research at the top of the editor.

Choose __'collaboration'__, search for the user you want to cooperate with and add her or him by clicking on their name.

The users that were added will show up as a list below the field. After clicking submit, collaborators will receive an invitation from you in their message-box which they can accept or decline. When accepting the invitation, the collaborator will have access to your exposition workspace and he will be able to edit it.

### Removing a Collaborator

If you want to remove a collaborator, click the "x" behind their name in
the field they were added. If you remove a supervisor, the supervisor
will receive a request to remove them (they have to approve the removal).

Note: If a users name in the list is enclosed in brackets ( [ name ]
), it means that the invitation is sent successfully, but has not been
accepted yet by the receiver.

### Communication with Collaborators

While collaborating on an exposition, there are several ways of communicating with each other

* __Using the note tool__
	Notes are the RC equivalent of yellow post it notes. You can simply drag one from the toolbar onto the exposition workspace. See also the note tool help.

* __Send collaboration message__
	You can send a direct text message to your collaborator using the *Send collaboration message* found under the __commands___ tab.

* __Posting a comment__
	In expositions where you are not a collaborator, you can still leave comments by going to the top bar of the exposition and clicking the __Comments__.
