# Collaborating on Research

The Research Catalogue allows you to collaborate on a research exposition with multiple users. An author of an exposition can invite collaborators through the collaboration tab of the exposition: click the menu icon (1) and 'edit details' (2) next to the research on your profile (or click on the name of your exposition in the exposition workspace), choose 'collaboration', search for the user you want to cooperate with and add him by clicking on their name. The users that were added will show up as a list below the field. After clicking submit, collaborators will receive an invitation from you in their message-box which they can accept or decline. When accepting the invitation, the collaborator will have access to your exposition workspace and he will be able to edit it.

### Removing a Collaborator

If you want to remove a collaborator, click the x behind their name in the field they were added. If you remove a supervisor, the supervisor will receive a requist to remove them.

Note: If a users name in the list is enclosed in brackets ( [ name ] ), it means that the invitation is sent succesfully, but has not been accepted yet by the receiver. 

There are 3 types of collaborators :

- *co-author* the collaborator is considered a co-author of the research and will be presented in the author list of the research exposition 
- *contributor* this type of collaborator has the same rights but won't feature as co-author of your exposition. An example of a contributor might be a 'graphical designer' helping with the layout of your exposition without having any involvement with the research itself.
- *supervisor* can view an exposition and leave comments. The supervisor will also be mentioned in the metadata.

### Communication with Collaborators

While collaborating on an exposition, there are several ways of communicating with each other

* __Using the note tool__
	Notes are the RC equivalent of yellow post it notes. You can simply drag one from the toolbar onto the exposition workspace. See also the note tool helpfile.

* __Send collaboration message__
	You can send a direct text message to your collaborator using the *Send collaboration message* found under the __commands___ tab.

* __Posting a comment__
	In expositions where you are not a collaborator, you can still leave comments by going to the top bar of the exposition and clicking the __Comments__.
