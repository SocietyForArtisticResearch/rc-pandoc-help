# About the Research Catalogue

The Research Catalogue (RC) is a non-commercial, collaboration and publishing platform for artistic research provided by the <a href="https://societyforartisticresearch.org" title="SAR website" target="_blank">Society for Artistic Research</a>. The RC is free to use for artists and researchers. It serves also as a backbone for teaching purposes, student assessment, peer review workflows and research funding administration. It strives to be an open space for experimentation and exchange. 

Research Catalogue (RC) content presented through some of our portals is peer reviewed, while the remaining expositions and other information are quality controlled by the individual author(s) themselves. As a result, the RC is highly inclusive. 

The open source status of the RC is essential to its nature and serves
its function as a connective and transitional layer between academic
discourse and artistic practice, thereby constituting a discursive
field for artistic research.

The Research Catalogue is provided by the Society for Artistic
Research (SAR).

## What can I use the RC for?

Research Catalogue has been used for publishing articles, project documentation, thesis works, peer reviewed journal publications and course materials within the field of Artistic Research.

## Why use RC ?

The RC creates a link between:

1. elaborated documentation of artistic work,
2. expositions and comments that engage with the contribution of the work as research
3. creation of individual profiles that present the researchers work.

It is believed that the reflective space provided by the RC
constitutes an essential part of the research process by providing a
suitable structure in which to develop the relationship between
documentation and presentation, whilst also retaining congruence with
art itself.

In the Research Catalogue's graphical editor, authors can combine different media and tailor the layout in which these materials are presented, depending on the needs of the project. Contents can be freely positioned and even layered on top of each other, in order to create detailed, non-linear and structured documents. This allows you to create maps, timelines, diagrams, staged presentations, clouds, mind-maps, networks etc.

In addition to the graphical editor, there is also a block-based editor, optimized for efficiently publishing more traditionally structured research articles.

One of the more practical benefits of using RC is that page layouts and media content are stored inside the platform. This means you don't have to worry about hosting or keeping your platform online. 

## What is an RC Exposition ?

The RC allows authors to create custom designed webpages called
__expositions__. __Expositions__ can contain many types of media
including: text, video, images, and audio recordings.  The way in
which these materials are presented is highly customizable. Expositions can be edited either using a graphical
drag-and-drop editor or written using a text-based editor. Various
types of import formats are also supported. Multiple
authors can collaborate in a single exposition.

## Connection between RC and JAR

The RC forms the technical backbone of the Journal for Artistic
Research (JAR): potential JAR expositions emerge from the range of the
artistic research activities taking place in the RC. Moreover,
submissions and peer-reviewing for JAR takes place in the RC. Expositions published in JAR are either nominated by authors, or directly selected by JAR editorial board.

# Basic Account vs full Account

When you register an account in the RC, you will first just have a basic account. This will allow you to be a supervisor, review expositions, and leave comments. Some application calls may also accept limited user accounts to submit forms. 

Limited accounts do not have the option to create expositions or publish work.
Due to copyright laws, if you are interested in making your content public in the Research Catalogue, you need to register as author by upgrading your limited account to a full account. <span
class="red">Important: if you are a student or staff member of an institution
that has a portal within the RC, you should contact your local portal admin for
upgrading to a full account. You can find the contact info of portal admins 
<a

The account upgrade is free of charge. You can upgrade your limited account by logging in, and clicking "request
upgrade", where you will be instructed to send in a proof of identity to
support@researchcatalogue.net. Please read about "safe upgrade" below, to make sure
you send this information safely.

## Institutional Portals, Journals and Project Portals

It is possible for institutions to open their own Institutional Portal in the Research Catalogue. 
Having a portal will allow institutions to:

- Publish research to a highly relavant audience (there are 30000 registered users in the RC, all specific to the Artistic Research field).
- Use the RC to manage, edit, review and publish a rich media online journal.
- Use RC as a teaching platform for students.
- Organize researchers in portal subgroups, for easy collaboration of a small group of authors.
- Publish and share research resources interally to only the users connected to the portal.
- Use the RC as a closed archive.
