## About the Research Catalogue

The Research Catalogue (RC) is a non-commercial, collaboration and publishing platform for artistic research provided by the <a href="https://societyforartisticresearch.org" title="SAR website" target="_blank">Society for Artistic Research</a>. The RC is free to use for artists and researchers. It serves also as a backbone for teaching purposes, student assessment, peer review workflows and research funding administration. It strives to be an open space for experimentation and exchange. 

Research Catalogue (RC) content presented through some of our portals is peer reviewed, while the remaining expositions and other information are quality controlled by the individual author(s) themselves. As a result, the RC is highly inclusive. 

The open source status of the RC is essential to its nature and serves
its function as a connective and transitional layer between academic
discourse and artistic practice, thereby constituting a discursive
field for artistic research.

The RC creates a link between:

1. elaborated documentation of artistic work,
2. expositions and comments that engage with the contribution of the work as research
3. creation of individual profiles that present the researchers work.

It is believed that the reflective space provided by the RC
constitutes an essential part of the research process by providing a
suitable structure in which to develop the relationship between
documentation and presentation, whilst also retaining congruence with
art itself.

## What can I use the RC for?

Research Catalogue has been used for publishing articles, project documentation, dissertations, thesis works, peer reviewed journal publications and course materials within the field of Artistic Research. It has also been used as a collaboration and communication tool in workshops, seminars and conferences.

## Why use RC ?

In the Research Catalogue's editors, authors can combine different media and tailor the layout in which these materials are presented, depending on the needs of the project. In the RC:

* images and sounds are not subordinate to, but fundamentally on a par with the text;
* possibility of non-linear presentation of results
* authors can present work-in-progress

 
 With RC's graphical layout, objects can be freely positioned and even on top of each other, aiding in the creation of detailed, non-linear and structured documents. This allows you to create maps, timelines, diagrams, staged presentations, clouds, mind-maps, networks etc.

In addition to the graphical editor, there is also a block-based editor, optimized for efficiently publishing more traditionally structured research articles.

One of the more practical benefits of using RC is that page layouts and media content are stored inside the platform. This means you don't have to worry about hosting or keeping your platform online. 

### What is an RC Exposition ?

The RC allows the user to create custom designed webpages called
__expositions__. These __expositions__ can contain many types of media
including: text, video, images, and audio recordings.  The way in
which these materials are presented is highly customizable by the
user. Expositions can be edited either using a graphical
drag-and-drop editor or written using a text-based editor. Various
types of import formats are also supported. Collaboration of multiple
authors on the development of a single exposition is also possible.

### Connection between RC and JAR

The RC forms the technical backbone of the Journal for Artistic
Research (JAR): potential JAR expositions emerge from the range of the
artistic research activities taking place in the RC. Moreover,
submissions and peer-reviewing for JAR takes place in the RC. Authors
may nominate or JAR editors may select expositions for development as
JAR contributions.

If you think that the RC software might also support your research
database needs then explore the possibility of using the RC as your
repository by contacting us.

The Research Catalogue is provided by the Society for Artistic
Research (SAR).

# Basic Account vs full Account

When you register an account in the RC, you will first just have a basic
account. This will allow you to be a supervisor, review expositions, and leave
comments. Some application calls may also accept limited user accounts to
submit forms. 

Limited accounts do not have the option to create expositions or publish work.
For legal reasons regarding copyright, the Research Catalogue has to be able to
identify the author of what is made public. Thus to make research public in the
Research Catalogue, you will first have to upgrade to a full account. <span
class="red">Important: if you are a student or staff member of an institution
that has a portal within the RC, you should contact your local portal admin for
upgrading to a full account. You can find the contact info of portal admins 
<a
href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/1369076/1369075">here</a>.</span>


You can upgrade your limited account by logging in, and clicking "request
upgrade", where you will be instructed to send in a proof of identity to
support@researchcatalogue.net. Please read about "safe upgrade" below, to make sure
you send this information safely.

## Safe upgrade 

[support@researchcatalogue.net](mailto:support@researchcatalogue.net "mail user support") supports OpenPGP email signing to prevent
sensitive information from going lost. If you have never used OpenPGP, by far,
the easiest way is to use Mozilla's Thunderbird application, which has OpenPGP
built-in, is free and well documented.

## Institutional Portals, Journals and Project Portals

It is possible for institutions to start their own Portal within the Research Catalogue. 
Having a portal will allow institutions to:

- Publish research to a highly relavant audience (there are 30000 registered users in the RC, all specific to the Artistic Research field).
- Use the RC to manage, edit, review and publish a rich media online journal 
- Use RC as a teaching platform for students
- Organize researchers in portal subgroups, for easy collaboration of a small group of authors.
- Publish and share research resources interally to only the users connected to the portal
- Use the RC as a closed archive
