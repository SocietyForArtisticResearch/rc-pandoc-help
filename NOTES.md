Notes 11/10/2016
* More linking within documentation
* "Back to toc" should not appear in pdf


* Language needs checking. View is badly written and hard to
  understand.
* The TOC should only contain sections "#" and "##"
* "###" is the maximum subsection to be used (however not displayed in
  the TOC)
* "back to toc" needs to be in a template file
* Use Pandoc markdown format (not github...)
