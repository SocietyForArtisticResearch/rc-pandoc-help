## HTML Import

It is possible to import a website of static HTML into the RC. This
feature is aimed at users that know HTML and want to use their own
editor. 

For security reasons, JavaScript is not supported, but CSS
files, <img> <video> <audio> tags can be used. The folder containing
your HTML files need to be uploaded as a zip file (.zip).

Important: at this moment, the RC Journals do not accept submissions imported as
HTML, because they do not fit in existing reviewing/editing
workflows. If you are planning to submit your exposition to one of the
journals in the RC, one should use the graphical or the text based
editor.

The website folder needs to have a certain structure to be imported correctly: 

### Requirements for HTML expositions

* The root folder needs to contain a file named index.html, this will be the page where the exposition opens.
* All other HTML files in the root folder will be added to the table of contents.
* Do not nest folders into folders.
* You can use .html .css and various media formats, mp4, mp3 etc..
  You do not have to transcode.
* JavaScript is currently not supported for security reasons, if present, import will fail.
* The character encoding of the .html files should be UTF-8
