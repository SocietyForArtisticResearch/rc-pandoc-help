<h2 id="about-the-research-catalogue">About the Research Catalogue</h2>
<p>RC content presented through some of our portals is peer reviewed, while the remaining expositions and other information are quality controlled by the individual author(s) themselves. As a result, the RC is highly inclusive.</p>
<p>The open source status of the RC is essential to its nature and serves its function as a connective and transitional layer between academic discourse and artistic practice, thereby constituting a discursive field for artistic research.</p>
<p>The RC creates a link between:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>elaborated documentation of artistic work,</li>
<li>expositions and comments that engage with the contribution of the work as research</li>
<li>creation of individual profiles that present the researchers work.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is believed that the reflective space provided by the RC constitutes an essential part of the research process by providing a suitable structure in which to develop the relationship between documentation and presentation, whilst also retaining congruence with art itself.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-an-rc-exposition">What is an RC Exposition ?</h3>
<p>The RC allows the user to create custom designed webpages called <strong>expositions</strong>. These <strong>expositions</strong> can contain many types of media including: text, video, images, and audio recordings. The way in which these materials are presented is highly customizable by the user. Expositions can be edited either using a graphical drag-and-drop editor or written using a text-based editor. Various types of import formats are also supported. Collaboration of multiple authors on the development of a single exposition is also possible.</p>
<h3 id="connection-between-rc-and-jar">Connection between RC and JAR</h3>
<p>The RC forms the technical backbone of the Journal for Artistic Research (JAR): potential JAR expositions emerge from the range of the artistic research activities taking place in the RC. Moreover, submissions and peer-reviewing for JAR takes place in the RC. Authors may nominate or JAR editors may select expositions for development as JAR contributions.</p>
<p>If you think that the RC software might also support your research database needs then explore the possibility of using the RC as your repository by contacting us.</p>
<p>The Research Catalogue is provided by the Society for Artistic Research (SAR).</p>
<p><a id="licences"></p>
<h2 id="licenses">Licenses</h2>
<p>Authors can select a license for each exposition or media file they upload in the RC. A license informs other people if and how you allow your material to be (re)used. The RC provides the following options:</p>
<ul>

<h1 id="my-profile-page">My Profile Page</h1>
<p>The RC profile page is both the central hub for your activities on the RC and a public presentation of your research activities. The RC allows you to create a detailed public profile containing biographical data, information on projects and events as well as a list of your RC objects such as media sets and expositions. The profile is divided into two sections, the upper sections contains an artist biography as well as information of research interests and the lower part, which is titled “Research” contains a list of RC works and exposition.</p>
<h2 id="profile-section">Profile Section</h2>
<h3 id="view-public-profile">View Public Profile</h3>
<p>You can switch between your profile’s editing mode (private) and your public profile, which is the profile as other users see it. Click on “my profile” for the editing mode and - below your image - click “view public profile” to hide all controls, grouping options and private research. You can thus control the public visibility of your RC objects.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/view_public_profile.png" title="view public profile" alt="view public profile" /><figcaption>view public profile</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>You can add a short text (for example a biography), that other RC users will see when they visit your profile. To edit this text, click “edit profile”, on your profile page and scroll down. Here you can also add a tagline, set your country of residence, and list your research interests.</p>
<h3 id="uploading-a-cv">Uploading a CV</h3>
<p>In addition to the profile description, it is possible to upload a more extended CV as a PDF. To do so, click “upload cv” below your profile picture.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/upload_cv.png" title="upload a cv" alt="upload your cv" /><figcaption>upload your cv</figcaption>
</figure>
<!-- ### Degrees -->
<!-- You can also add your __degrees__ to your profile. Enter the
name, the level, the dates and the institution of your degree and link
it via the __relations-tab__ to projects, expositions or works that
you created in support for your degree. -->
<h3 id="member-of">Member of</h3>
<p>As a user you can request membership of (some of the) RC portals. Certain actions can only be done if one is a member of the portal. For example: for some application programs, it may be required that you are member of the portal before you are able to submit an application for a program.</p>
<p>In most cases however, it is the task of the portal admin to make you a member of their portal, most portals do theirfore not allow users to request membership themselves.</p>
<p>Click edit to ask for a request to become a portal member, or remove yourself from a portal.</p>
<h2 id="research-section">Research Section</h2>
<h3 id="grouping">Grouping</h3>
<p>When you create a new work or exposition the newly created objects appear in default groupings (“Sets” and “Expositions”). By using the “add grouping” button you can create custom groupings. You can arrange objects according to freely created categories.</p>
<p>To add a new group click “add grouping” and enter the name of the grouping. You can sort your objects within a group, arrange the groups themselves and move object between groups via drag and drop. Click and drag a grouping to change the order of the groups. On the right-hand side of a grouping’s title, there are a series of icons displayed. Here you can edit and delete the grouping and control its public visibility (using the circle icon).</p>
<p>Only custom grouping can be deleted. If you have only one grouping containing content, its title will not be shown on your public profile. Empty groups will also not be displayed on your public profile page.</p>
<h3 id="create-exposition">Create Exposition</h3>
<p>By clicking “Create exposition” you can create a new exposition object which will be opened in the RC exposition workspace editor. The <strong>title</strong>, <strong>copyright</strong> and <strong>abstract</strong> fields are obligatory. In most cases, the copyright field should be the same as the main author name (so you can write your own name). You can change these details later by choosing ☰ &gt; <strong>edit details</strong>, or in the <strong>workspace editor</strong> by clicking the title of your research (at the top of you screen).</p>
<p>There are two types of exposition on the RC:</p>
<ul>
<li>Graphical</li>
<li>Text-based</li>
<li>HTML-based</li>
<li>Research Video (only available through ZHDK portal)</li>
</ul>
<p>The graphical editor gives the user more control over position of objects and is best used for expositions wich require non-linear layouts. See <a href="#comparison-of-rc-exposition-formats%20%22compare%20the%20two%20exposition%20formats%22">comparison</a>.</p>
<p>For more info on the text editor, see <a href="#text-based-editor">text based editor</a>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/add-research-dialog.png" title="image showing the add research dialog" alt="create exposition" /><figcaption>create exposition</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="add-work">Add Work</h3>
<p>Works are an older feature, which has now been replaced by media sets through the <a href="#media-repository">media repository</a>. If you had created works previously, you can still edit or remove them.</p>
<h3 id="add-project">Add Project</h3>
<p>Projects were part of an external import of data, they are no longer available for users now.</p>
<h3 id="visibility-of-groupings">Visibility Of Groupings</h3>
<p>You can decide if you want a grouping to be visible in your public profile.</p>
<p>By default, new groupings are visible in your profile as soon as they contain an RC object. To hide groupings from your public profile click the small circle icon on the right hand side of the grouping’s name. If the circle is thin, the grouping will not be shown on your public profile.</p>
<h3 id="open-exposition">Open Exposition</h3>
<p>The button “open exposition” opens the first page (or “weave”) of your exposition. This is equivalent to the <strong>preview</strong> version in the exposition workspace.</p>
<h3 id="exposition-details-menu">Exposition Details Menu</h3>
<figure>
<img src="images/hamburger_location.png" title="image showing location of menu button" alt="object menu location" /><figcaption>object menu location</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To access the menu, click on the (“hamburger”) menu icon, located in the bottom right corner of an object (expositions or works). Some options are only available to the author of the object.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Change layout</strong> change the size of an object on the profile.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Edit workspace</strong> go to the workspace editor of this exposition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Edit details</strong> change the meta data of your exposition, and control collaboration with other users. See <a href="#edit-research">edit research</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Share</strong> change who can see and access this item.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Self-publish</strong> turn an exposition into a fixed state. <br/>Please note that publishing is a one-way action, <em>once published one can not unpublish</em>. If you want to keep the option of removing an exposition, do not use this option.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Add to shortcut</strong> add a compact link to this object on the top of your profile.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Submit for publication</strong> submit an exposition to a portal for publication.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Connect to portal</strong> send a connection request to a portal.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Manage versions</strong> create or restore snapshots, see <a href="#manage-versions">versions</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Export</strong> this function downloads a zip file, containing a HTML Export of the exposition. These HTML files can be opened on any computer with a browser, also offline. The start page is named <strong>index.html</strong> .</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Delete</strong> delete an exposition or work from the RC.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="change-layout">Change Layout</h3>
<p>This dialogue gives you the option of choosing the size of the research description boxes on your profile page.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/change-layout.png" title="image displaying layout options for research on My Profile" alt="The 4 options for how to display research on your profile" /><figcaption>The 4 options for how to display research on your profile</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Depending on the length of the content, the abstract and additional information may be reduced or even hidden. Sizing objects differently allows to focus a reader’s attention to important objects as well as to improve the overall readability of your profile page.</p>
<p>Four layout-templates are possible:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>tall and across both columns</p></li>
<li><p>tall but only one column wide</p></li>
<li><p>short and only one column wide, the smalles possible size</p></li>
<li><p>short and across both columns</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="manage-versions">Manage versions</h2>
<p>It is possible to create a snapshot of your exposition, which you can restore later.</p>
<p>A snapshot is created by going to ☰ &gt; <strong>versions</strong> and clicking <strong>add snapshot</strong>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/manage-versions.png" title="image showing manage versions dialog" alt="version dialog" /><figcaption>version dialog</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When you restore a snapshot, the original is not overwritten, instead a new exposition will be created from the snapshot.</p>
<p>There are three options for how to deal with the <a href="#collaborating-on-research">collaboration</a> settings of a restored snapshot:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>private</strong> remove all collaborators (only you can see the restored exposition snapshot).</li>
<li><strong>restore</strong> the collaboration will be as it was when the snapshot was taken.</li>
<li><strong>keep</strong> the collaboration as it is in the current version of the exposition.</li>
</ul>
<p>One can also restore as private and change the settings afterwards of course, through the collaboration and share menus.</p>
<h3 id="versions-of-published-expositions">Versions of published expositions</h3>
<p>Published expositions cannot be changed in the RC (this is per definition, to allow referencing content within these expositions by other researchers), but duplicates can !</p>
<p>To get an editable duplicate of a published exposition one has to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>make a snapshot of the published exposition.</li>
<li>restore the snapshot.</li>
</ol>
<p>This duplicate can now be edited, without the changes having effect on the original published exposition.</p>
<h2 id="edit-research">Edit Research</h2>
<p>This dialog can be opened by <strong>☰ &gt; edit details</strong> or clicking the title of the exposition in the workspace editor.</p>
<figure>
<embed src="images/edit-research.png%20%22image%20showing%20edit%20research%20dialog%22" /><figcaption>Edit research dialog, showing meta page</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meta data</strong> change the <strong>title</strong>, <strong>date</strong>, <strong>abstract</strong>, <strong>keywords</strong>, <strong>affiliation</strong> and <strong>external link</strong> fields for your exposition.<br />
A <strong>title</strong> and <strong>abstract</strong> are obligatory.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Author Pseudonym</strong> field allows you to display the exposition under a different name. If one is provided, the author pseudonym will replace the authors names wherever the work is shown on RC (and in the <a href="https://www.doi.org">DOI</a> deposit, if the exposition is published). This can also be used if a group of author(s) wants to appear under a group name. The full list of authors will be shown on the metadata page.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the <strong>meta</strong> tab, one can also set the <strong>entry page</strong>: the weave that is the first page that the reader sees. <br /></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Table of content</strong> change the content menu, which the user can use to navigate between pages. See <a href="#table-of-content">table-of-content</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Collaboration</strong> add co-authors, editors and supervisors. See <a href="#collaborating-on-research">collaboration</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Relations</strong> create relationships with other objects on your profile, which will result in them being listed on the Research page. This page is shown when somebody clicks the title of the research on your profile.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="choosing-an-editor">Choosing an Editor</h1>
<p>There are two types of editors in RC, the <strong>graphical</strong> editor and the <strong>text-based</strong> editor. Both editors can be used to create expositions that can be published, reviewed and submitted for publication. However, the design, the writing process as well as the way in which exposition can be read are significantly different.</p>
<p>When creating a new exposition you are asked to choose a format to use. After the exposition has been created, one cannot change the format anymore. It is therefore important to make the right choice for a particular project at the outset.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/format-picker.png" title="image showing format picker" alt="choosing a format in the Create Exposition dialog" /><figcaption>choosing a format in the Create Exposition dialog</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The <strong>graphical editor</strong>, which is documented <a href="#workspace-editor">here</a>, allows the author to set the position of each element in the page. This makes it easy to have non-linear formats or presentations in which the media, such as images, video and audio files, are as important, if not more important, as the text. The editor works by dragging and dropping. There is no predefined style or template and its possible to have the reader go through the content in a non-linear fashion. However, a consequence of absolutely positioning all elements is that the exposition cannot adjust to the size of a particular device, that is, these expositions are not “responsive”. If you want readers to be able to read your exposition on mobile device the text-based editor may be more suitable for your project.</p>
<p>The <strong>text-based</strong>, which is documented <a href="#text-based-editor">here</a>, editor is designed for writing (and importing) texts, while supporting the embedding of media. The input is plain text, which is translated into HTML. The author can express the structure of the text using <a href="http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> notation. Because the input is plain text, it can also be automatically imported and exported from and to various external formats, for example MS Word documents, Open office documents and LateX. Styling is applied using standard CSS. By default the structure of the exposition is maintained, while the sizes of the text will adjust for readability on different screen sizes. Text-based expositions are <em>responsive</em>.</p>
<p>For users that need more customization, there is an option to <a href="#html-import">import static HTML</a> website as a whole. The RC does not provide editors for HTML, so for that option an external editor is to be used. JavaScript is not supported.</p>
<p>Finally, there is an option to import an Research Video, from https://www.zhdk.ch/forschungsprojekt/research-video–549545</p>

<h1 id="media-repository">Media Repository</h1>
<p>The media repository allows RC users to navigate, organize and manage their media. Each user can browse the media that is used in their expositions (the <a href="https://guide.researchcatalogue.net/#simple-media">simple media</a>) or collect media files and texts with which to create an exposition later. Beyond organizing media, you can share it with other users of the RC. You can upload media, organize it into <a href="#sets"><strong>sets</strong></a> and share it with other users of the RC. It extends and replaces the older “Works” feature.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/media-repository.png" title="image showing the media repository" alt="Media repository" /><figcaption>Media repository</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="browsing">Browsing</h3>
<p>The media browser contains three tabs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Media</strong></p>
<p>The complete list of all media.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>My sets</strong></p>
<p>Your media sets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sets shared with you</strong></p>
<p>Media sets that have been shared with you by others.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are two ways of displaying the media or sets:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>gallery view</strong> displays a preview image of the entities and helps finding media visually.</li>
<li>The <strong>list view</strong> is better suited for sorting media or sets. Click on a column to sort a list by a certain property.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="filter-and-search">Filter and Search</h3>
<p>The filter can be used to only show certain types of media. You can filter by <a href="#tags"><strong>tags</strong></a>, <a href="#keywords"><strong>keywords</strong></a>, date and media type.</p>
<h3 id="creating-new-media">Creating new media</h3>
<p>There are various ways to create new media:</p>
<h3 id="upload">Upload</h3>
<p>Click “<strong>Upload media</strong>” to add a new file. Once you have select one or more files, you will be asked to provide at least copyright information. If you are the creator, you can fill in your own name here.</p>
<p>Accepted types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Video (most common formats)</li>
<li>Audio</li>
<li>PDF</li>
<li>Text files: plain / html / markdown</li>
<li>Images : .png .gif .jpg .svg .tiff</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Transcoding audio and video:</strong></p>
<p>The Media Repository accepts all common audio and video formats and will automatically convert them to web compatible format. Audio is transcoded to 256 kbps mp3, video to mp4 with the original resolution.</p>
<h3 id="multi-upload">Multi-upload</h3>
<p>You can select multiple files to upload at once or a folder containing several files. You will be presented with a form block for each file. In order to ease such a workflow you can apply the copyright information and the set you want to add the media to from one form to all other forms.</p>
<h3 id="text">Text</h3>
<p>Text is a media type in the media repository.</p>
<p>You can also create snippets of text by using the “<strong>create text</strong>” button. You can select between three different types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plain text</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>Markdown</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="metadata">Metadata</h2>
<p>Every album and media entry is linked to set of metadata that include copyright and licensing information as well as a title and the following fields:</p>
<h3 id="description-1">Description</h3>
<p>The description is not typically displayed for a reader of an exposition but allows the author to provide additional information.</p>
<p><a id="tags"></p>
<h3 id="tags">Tags</h3>
<p>Tags are meant for personal organization. Typical examples would be “todo”, “old”, “archive”, “new”, or “in progress”. They are private to your RC account, so no other users will see them.</p>
<p><a id="keywords"></p>
<h3 id="open-keywords">Open Keywords</h3>
<p>Open keywords are shared with the entire RC, any user can add any new term to the global namespace.</p>
<p>You can either search for existing open keywords or create your own, if the term has not been used before.</p>
<p>To prevent duplicates, the RC does not differentiate between upper and lower case, for example: “Art” and “art” are understood to be the same thing.</p>
<h3 id="closed-keywords">Closed Keywords</h3>
<p>Closed keywords are part of a closed and controlled vocabulary administered and continuously extended by the RC. They are chosen so that we can more easily interact with other repositories. They cannot be extended by individual users.</p>
<p><a id="sets"></p>
<h3 id="license">License</h3>
<p>see <a href="#licenses">licenses</a></p>
<h2 id="sets-and-sharing">Sets and Sharing</h2>
<p>Media can be organized in sets. Media can belong to multiple sets at once. You can create a new set and by clicking “select” you can choose the media belongs to a set.</p>
<p>Media sets can be shared with other users and in portals. Click <strong>share</strong> to open the share form. There are three sections in this form:</p>
<ul>
<li>The top section of this form allows you to control the visibility of the set on your profile.</li>
<li>The middle section allows you to invite collaborates. These users will only have read access (default) or they have write access, which allows them to remove or change metadata and media belonging to the set.</li>
<li>The bottom section allows you to share a set in portals. Other members of the portal in which you share a set will see the set on your profile even if you don’t publicly share it.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="graphical-editor---views">Graphical Editor - Views</h1>
<h2 id="preview">Preview</h2>
<p>The preview is the final result that the reader will see when he/she opens your exposition, for example by opening the exposition URL or when a user clicks “OPEN EXPOSITION” anywhere on the RC. All expositions have <a href="#navigation">a navigation bar</a> that shows if the user moves his/her mouse to the top. It contains a table of contents, abstract and other information.</p>
<p>While you are editing your exposition in the workspace editor, the Preview button (👁, right top corner) shows what the page will look like to the reader. If you already have a preview tab open, the second time you click Preview, it will simply refresh, instead of opening a new tab.</p>
<!-- THIS SHOULD BE IN VIDEO AND AUDIO TOOLS ?
Note, that the video player, the audio player, the slideshow and object tool are only displayed fully in this PREVIEW view. 
-->
<p>Note: while for the reader the exposition will always open the <strong>entry page</strong> of your exposition, clicking the PREVIEW button in the editor shows the page that you currently are working on in your workspace. Thus, you can also PREVIEW pages that are not yet listed in the table of contents.</p>
<h2 id="workspace-view">Workspace View</h2>
<figure>
<img src="images/workspace-view-2018.png" title="image showing workspace view" alt="workspace view of the graphical exposition format" /><figcaption>workspace view of the graphical exposition format</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The <strong>workspace editor</strong> is the editor of content on the RC. It can be opened by clicking <strong>☰ &gt; edit workspace</strong> on an exposition listed on your profile. If you are reading one of your own expositions, you can also open the editor by clicking <strong>EDIT</strong> in the navigation bar on top. Which editor will show will depend on the format.</p>
<p>Published epositions cannot be edited (by definition) and you need to be the author, co-author or editor of an exposition to be able to edit an exposition.</p>
<p>Within the workspace view, one can enable one of these two subviews:</p>
<!-- ### Note view
 
The note-view is to be used in conjunction with the note-tool of the
RC. Notes are meant to be used to communicate between author and
reviewers or supervisors and authors. The note-view displays a list of
all the notes that are within an exposition. One can filter this list
based on the author, assignee and depending on its status (resolved,
unresolved). You can also change these parameters in this view. 

### Text view

The text-view displays the text content of your exposition. You can
activate the text-view by clicking on the button on the
view-options. You have the opportunity to show or hide changes. You
can also sort the items and open the html-editor to directly edit the
content in the text-view.
 
You can close both views by clicking on "close note view" or "close
text view" in the top-right.

<h2 id="editor-basics">Editor Basics</h2>
<p>When you open the editor you will see math-paper like area in the center, this is called the grid. Content is added by dragging-and-dropping “tools” from the toolbar onto the grid. You can preview what the exposition looks like to the reader by clicking the “preview” button: <img src="images/eye_metro.svg" class="icon">. This preview button is located at the top right.</p>
<p>The position of content in graphical expositions is determined by the author and absolute. This implies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tools are not positioned relative to each other, (re)moving one will not affect the others.</li>
<li>The canvas size is unlimited: it will grow automatically when you add tools.</li>
<li>Tools can be placed on top of each other.</li>
<li>Layout will not change depending on the screensize of the viewer (content is not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">“responsive”</a> ).</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above results in the graphical editor being most suitable for non-linear layouts. For simpler expositions, it can be worthwhile to consider using the text based editor ( see <a href="https://guide.researchcatalogue.net/#choosing-an-editor">choosing an editor</a> ).</p>
<p>On the right you will find the content manager, consisting of four tabs:</p>

<h2 id="defaults">Defaults</h2>
<p>Defaults for styling and options can be set for a tool, by clicking it in the toolbar.</p>
<h2 id="text-tool">Text Tool</h2>
<p>A video tutorial about the text tool is found <a href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/273532/273533/0/937" title="link to video tutorials">here</a></p>
<p>The text tool is designed for quickly adding text.</p>
<p>It has two states: when it is in <em>active state</em> you can change the text, if you click outside of the tool, you can move the tool and change its size. Double click inside of the tool to start editing the text again. Content is saved as soon as you exit the text editing state.</p>
<p>If you right-click the text tool, you can find some extra edit options under <strong>edit</strong>. You can also (while hovering over a text tool with your mouse) click the (☰) menu icon and choose <strong>edit</strong>.</p>
<p>In comparison to the HTML-tool, the text tool allows you to edit your text directly on the page. While the HTML-tool opens a new dialog window. If you need more styling options, or want change the HTML source code of text, use the HTML-tool. A text tool can be converted to an HTML-tool via the menu option <strong>convert to HTML tool</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="placing-images-on-top-of-text-tools">Placing images on top of text tools</h3>
<p><strong>Never place other tools (like images) directly on top of long text tools</strong>. Because of small differences in how fonts are displayed within major browsers, and the fixed position of RC tools, this can result in text overflowing into those tools if the reader uses a different browser than the author that made the exposition.</p>
<p>The issue is easily avoided by keeping to this rule: always start a new text tool below an inline image or tool:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/proper-use-text.png" title="Image showing the proper use of text tools" alt="proper way of combining text with other tools" /><figcaption>proper way of combining text with other tools</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="scrollbars">Scrollbars</h3>
<p>If the text within a text tool is longer than the tool height, a scrollbar will appear and part of the text is cutoff. Therefore (especially when copying from external editors) it is important to check that the tool has a large enough size (unless you specifically want a scrollbar).</p>
<h3 id="style">Style</h3>
<p>See <a href="#style-options">style options</a>.</p>
<h3 id="options">Options</h3>
<p>If a text is longer than its frame on the weave, a scrollbar is generated automatically. You can control the visibility of the scrollbar in <strong>options</strong>. The default setting is <em>automatic</em>. Be careful setting this to <strong>never</strong>: if a text tool is too small to display all the text, it will be impossible for the reader to see all the text.</p>
<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>See <a href="#history">history</a>.</p>
<h2 id="html-tool">HTML-Tool</h2>
<p>The HTML-tool is used for advanced text editing. It is a <em>what-you-see-is-what-you-get</em> rich text editor. Unlike the text tool, you can only edit its content in a dialog box.</p>
<p>You add the HTML Tool like any other tool: drag it with your mouse from the toolbar onto your canvas.</p>
<h3 id="media">Media</h3>
<figure>
<img src="images/html-tool.png" title="an image showing the html media tab" alt="html tool media tab" /><figcaption>html tool media tab</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Text is edited in the <strong>media</strong> tab. You can style your text using the buttons.</p>
<p><em>! important: If you copy-paste your text from Word, Pages, LibreOffice, Google Docs or any other text editor, note that not all fonts and styles will show the same on every computer. A safer practice is to import the text without any formatting, and format it within RC. This can be done either by exporting your text as plain text and copy pasting from that version, or importing your document using the <a href="#import-word-documents-using-simple-media-upload">document import</a></em></p>
<p>To enlarge the palette of text styling options, click on the first button, <strong>show/hide toolbars</strong>. Opening it will allow you to insert lists, enumerations, tables, citations.</p>
<p>Another commenly used feature is the hyperlink button (it looks like a chain link). This can be used to insert <a href="https://guide.researchcatalogue.net/#hyperlinking">hyperlinks</a> or <a href="https://guide.researchcatalogue.net/#footnotes">footnotes</a> into your text.</p>
<p>The top right button opens the editor in fullscreen. Note: you will have to exit full screen mode to submit your changes, using the same button.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/html-tool-bar-extended.png" alt="html extended tool options" /><figcaption>html extended tool options</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A few tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make sure the toolsize matches the length of the text within. If the text is too long, it will result in <strong>scrollbars</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>It is possible to add pictures or even iframes, but it is not recommended in most situations. Preferably media is added to the catalogue using the appropriate tools, to avoid the of risk external content going missing when it is removed by the original source.</p></li>
<li><p>Be careful making very large texts within a single HTML tool, this may result in unexpected overlap when your exposition is viewed with another browser. 3 or 4 paragraphs per tool is a good average. If you do make a large HTML tool, keep a large margin at the bottom bordor.</p></li>
<li><p>You can also choose the colour or the background of the text using the colour tools, insert symbols and tables, and control the edits with the <strong>show changes</strong> option.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If a text is longer than its frame on the weave, a scrollbar is generated automatically. You can control the visibility of the scrollbar in <strong>options</strong>. The default setting is <em>automatic</em>. Be careful setting this to <strong>never</strong>: if a text tool is too small to display all the text, it will be impossible for the reader to see all the text.</p>
<h3 id="templates">Templates</h3>
<p>If you want to reuse the content of an HTML-tool, you can create your own templates. This function can be found in the <strong>media</strong> tab. After finishing the edit of your template, click <strong>save</strong> <strong>as</strong> <strong>new</strong> <strong>template</strong> and give the template a name in the dialog box that appears. To load a template, click <strong>load template</strong> and choose one from the list in the dialog box.</p>
<h3 id="submit-delete-or-cancel">Submit, Delete, Or Cancel</h3>
<p>Finally, you need to exit the dialog window. If everything is the way you want it, choose <strong>submit</strong> and the text field will be loaded on the weave. To discard changes to the content, cancel the dialog box. If you want to delete the whole HTML field, including all content in it, click <strong>delete</strong>. Unintended deletions can be restored via <strong>commands</strong> – <strong>restore deleted tools</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="picture-tool">Picture Tool</h2>
<p>To add a picture, drag and drop the <strong>picture</strong> icon from the tool palette onto the weave. As with all other tools, a pop-up dialog appears automatically and gives you the choice between “selecting” or “adding” an item.</p>
<p>You can upload image files in the following formats: <em>jpg, png, tiff, gif, psd, tga, bmp.</em> For uploading PDFs, please use the PDF-tool.</p>
<p>To add an item, choose “add” and upload the object from your desktop to the RC servers. Name the file and make a declaration of the copyright holder. Once an image is uploaded it is also automatically added to the simple media tab.</p>
<h3 id="style-2">Style</h3>
<p><a href="#style-options">&gt; see style options</a></p>
<h3 id="options-2">Options</h3>
<p>There are options available to change how images are resized in relation to the green border containing the image. This is controlled by changing the size parameter, which can be set to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>contain</strong> : make the image small enough to fit without changing the aspect ratio (<strong>default</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>cover</strong> : crop part of the image that is not fitting (aspect ratio stays the same)</li>
<li><strong>fit</strong> : stretch the image (aspect ratio changes)</li>
<li><strong>auto</strong> : let the browser decide which part should be cut off</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also change the <em>position</em> within the border ie: top-left, right-bottom etc…</p>
<p>In <strong>settings</strong> you are able to lock the aspect ratio. And you can allow readers to enlarge the image by activating the checkbox “on click open image in popup.”.</p>
<p>If you want to use a picture as a hyperlink, paste a URL into the field <em>on click open link</em>.</p>
<p>You can also set a <em>tooltip text</em> (a text that shows when the user ‘hoovers’ his mouse over the picture) for the image. Set the <strong>show on hoover</strong> option to <strong>plain text</strong> and enter your text in the box below.</p>
<p>You can also make the tooltip display the copyright info, by setting the <strong>show on hoover</strong> option to <strong>copyright</strong>.</p>
<p>Please note, you can’t change the copyright information in the “edit picture” window. To change the name or the copyright text, close the current dialog and go to the item in <strong>simple media</strong> and click <strong>edit</strong> (also double click) to open the <strong>edit media</strong> dialog.</p>
<h2 id="audio-tool">Audio Tool</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/249652/249653">&gt; Audio tool tutorial</a></p>
<p>As with the other tools, use the audio tool by dragging and dropping the icon from the tool palette onto the weave. A pop-up dialog window appears automatically and gives you the choice between “selecting” or “adding” an item. Selecting is for previously uploaded media (either through other audio tools or the media manager). Adding allows you to upload a new file.</p>
<p>The following formats are supported: <em>ogg, wav, mov, au, mp4 audio container formats; mp2, mp3, aac, pcm a-law, flac audio codec</em> formats. All audio file formats will be transcoded to mp3s with 256kpbs.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/audio-tool-dialog.png" title="image showing Audio Tool Dialog" alt="Audio tool upload dialog" /><figcaption>Audio tool upload dialog</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To minimize loading times, audio files are automatically compressed. During the transcoding process, the name will be grayed out in the media list and a text will be shown in the preview.</p>
<p>RC encodes with a bitrate of 256 bits per second. For further information and technical questions see <a href="http://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/faq" title="FAQ">FAQ 2.6</a> or contact the RC User Support.</p>
<h3 id="style-3">Style</h3>

<p>The audio player has a number of settings:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>loop</strong> Will loop the playback when it reaches the end of the file.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>autoplay</strong> The player starts to play back the file as soon as the page has been loaded.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>stop other players</strong> If you are using multiple audio (or video) players on the same weave and your page is quite big, visitors may find it helpful if you prevent overlapping by defining which player is playing. With this option selected, all players (video player, audio player on slideshows, other audio players) will stop when the selected player is playing back a file. When simultaneous playback is desired, it may be helpful to use the <a href="#play-tool" title="jump to play tool help">Play-tool</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>display minimal</strong> When selected, the player consists of only the play button and bar. You can also define some visual player settings. You can hide the whole menu bar or you can set the visibility of the volume or define if you want a player with as few options as possible.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As in the picture tool, if it is necessary to give textual information about the sound file, you can enter the text to be displayed when the mouse cursor hovers over the item.</p>
<h2 id="video-tool">Video Tool</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/273532/273533/623/1369">Video tutorial</a></p>
<p>As with the other tools, you can use the video tool by dragging it from the tool bar and dropping it onto the weave.</p>
<p>In the dialog box that appears you have the possibility to add (i.e. upload) items from your computer or select items from the “simple media” folder. At the moment, the RC supports the following formats: <em>avi, mov, mp4, mpg</em> video container formats; <em>dv1394, h.264, mpeg2, mpeg1, mjepeg</em> video codec formats. Both VBR and CBR are supported.</p>
<p>The video tool currently supports resolutions up to 2048x1080. If the resolution is higher, transcoding will fail. Please keep this in mind while uploading videos shot on phones, which commonly provide up to 4k resolution.</p>
<p>To add an item, choose “add” and upload the file from your desktop to the RC servers. All videos uploaded in this way will also be added to the simple media tab. Name the file and make a declaration of the copyright holder.</p>
<p>After adding a video, the player will not appear in the workspace editor, to view it, please click PREVIEW at the top right corner of the editor.</p>
<p>All media will be compressed to a smaller size, this is called ‘transcoding’. This process takes time. During the ‘transcoding’ the file name is greyed out in your simple media. If you want, the RC can also sent you an email when transcoding has finished. You can find that option under <a href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/settings"><strong>profile, settings</strong></a>.</p>
<p>For further information and technical questions see <a href="http://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/faq" title="FAQ">FAQ</a> or contact the RC User Support.</p>
<p>We highly recommend using smaller video files, for easier upload. If your file is extremely large, you may want to compress it before uploading using a program like Handbrake, FFMpeg or QuickTime (Mac).</p>

With this option selected, all players (video player, audio player on slideshows, other audio players) will stop when the selected player is running a file. When simultaneous playback is desired, it may be helpful to use the <a href="#play-tool" title="jump to play tool help">Play-tool</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>display minimal</strong> When selected, the player constists of only the play button and the bar.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As in the picture tool, if it is necessary to provide textual information on the video file you can choose to display plain text or copyright information that will appear when the mouse cursor hovers over the item.</p>
<p>You can also use the play tool to synchronize selected video and audio tools.</p>
<h2 id="slideshow-tool">Slideshow Tool</h2>
<p>The slideshow tool allows you to create a gallery of images that can be displayed in a loop. You can choose to start the slideshow automatically and you can add an audio file to each picture of the slideshow.</p>
<p>Drag and drop the slideshow icon onto the weave and the dialog window will appear.</p>
<p>To be able to select media you first have to upload an item into <strong>simple media</strong> or select media files from your works. To add an item, choose <strong>add</strong> and upload the object from your desktop to the RC servers. Name the file and make a declaration of the copyright holder. After adding the file, you can edit the style of the picture with the html style standards. To add a sound file to the slide, the file first needs to be uploaded to simple media.</p>
<h3 id="style-5">Style</h3>
<p><a href="#style-options">&gt; see style options</a></p>
<h3 id="options-5">Options</h3>
<p>In “options” you can define the position of the image within the frame. This is important when you are using images with different sizes and proportions. In <strong>settings</strong> it is possible to choose to loop the slideshow. If the <strong>loop</strong> option is enable, the slideshow will continue with the first slide once it reaches its last slide. You can choose to hide the navigation bar or give the reader the option to enlarge the picture with a click on the picture in your weave.</p>
<p>In <strong>automate</strong> you can set the autoplay options to:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>run after click</em> : run automatically after the first click</li>
<li><em>autoplay</em> : after loading the page</li>
</ul>
<p>When choosing <em>autoplay</em> you need to define the speed with which the slide will change. You can customise the duration of each slide (<em>speed per slide</em>) or let each slide change at the default speed.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, you can append audio files to each slide. Please note, you first have to upload the file into your <strong>simple media</strong> folder. In <strong>options</strong>, <strong>audio</strong> you can control the time of a crossfade (when one audio file fades out while a second fades in at a specified time). You can also choose the fade duration and the timeout of an audio file.</p>
<h2 id="pdf-tool">PDF Tool</h2>
<p>The PDF tool gives you the possibility to add PDF documents containing texts, graphics or scores. By default the PDF is displayed as a small thumbnail showing a miniture of the first page. The reader of your exposition can load this PDF in a new tab by clicking the thumbnail. Alternatively, you can set the tool to display the PDF content directly embedded in the page (see <a href="#pdf-options%20%22link%20to%20pdf%20options%22">options</a>).</p>
<p>PDF is a suitable format for uploading (paper) based documents into your exposition. The limitation is that PDF files, by nature, only support static (printable) graphics and text, not video or audio. Although Abobe has started to support rich media embedding in their own PDF viewers, there is almost no support for this in other PDF viewers (like the one in browsers). In case text from a word processor needs to be combined with video and audio, use the <a href="#HTML-tool" title="link to html tool">HTML tool</a> for the text and add the media separately using the other tools.</p>
<h3 id="uploading-a-pdf">Uploading a pdf</h3>
<p>After dragging the icon to the weave, a dialog will show.<br />
Click the button <strong>ADD MEDIA</strong> to open the dialog for uploading a PDF.<br />
Be sure to upload the PDF itself in the <strong>PDF</strong> field, not <strong>PREVIEW</strong>. One is also requested to add copyright information. When done, click submit and the file will begin uploading.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/pdf-tool-dialog.png" title="Image showing the pdf tool dialog" alt="The pdf tool dialog" /><figcaption>The pdf tool dialog</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The <strong>PREVIEW</strong> field is for changing the image that represents the pdf in the exposition for the reader. If no preview image is provided, a miniturised copy of the first page will be used. You can later change the preview image, by selecting one from your media list.</p>
<h3 id="changing-the-pdf-preview-image">Changing the PDF preview image</h3>
<p>If you have an existing PDF tool, you can update the preview image with any image from your <a href="#media-list">media list</a>. If you want to use a completely new image, you will have to add it to your <a href="#media-list">media list</a> first.</p>
<ul>
<li>Double click the tool</li>
<li>Click the “change preview image” button</li>
<li>Select the image from the dropdown list</li>
<li>Submit</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="a-few-notes">A few notes</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Never re-use the url</strong> of the pdf file that opens when you click the pdf tool in the preview. For example: “https://media.researchcatalogue.net/rc/master/73723.pdf?t=2629205589&amp;e=1510816850” These (timed) links are automatically generated by the PDF tool specifically for the user that views the tool and are automatically invalidated after use.</p></li>
<li><p>On iOS devices, rotated PDF tools will not open when touched.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#style-options">&gt; see style options</a></p>
<p><a id="pdf-options"></a></p>
<h3 id="options-6">Options</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Position</strong></p>
<p>The <em>position</em> options (<em>size</em>, <em>position</em>) are only there for legacy reasons. Likely to be removed in future versions of the editor.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Settings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Display in Browser</strong></p>
<p>Option to “embed” the pdf: display its content directly in the page using the browsers built in PDF viewer. If the PDF is bigger than the box, scrollbars will appear.</p>
<em>Display in Browser</em> works best if:
<ul>
<li>your exposition page only contains a single PDF file and not much else.</li>
<li>your pdf is only 1 or 2 pages long and the tool is made large enough to fit the whole document. Always check with the <strong>preview</strong> how the PDF looks embedded.</li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend against putting other tools on top of a <strong>“display in browser”</strong> PDF tool, since browsers have slightly different margins on their PDF viewers : this may result in disalignment of content.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/pdf-display-in-browser.png" alt="Extra settings dialog of pdf tool" /><figcaption>Extra settings dialog of pdf tool</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As in the picture tool, you can set a text that the reader sees when they hoover the object. To do this, select one of the options in the “show on hover” pull-down menu. You can create a plain text to be displayed when the reader’s mouse hovers over the PDF preview. To use this, choose “plain text” or “copyright &amp; plain text” from the pull-down menu and write your text in the text field below.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="play-tool">Play Tool</h2>
<p>The play tool is designed to synchronize the playback of selected video and audio tools on the same weave. With this tool one can create a single control for playing back various media files at the same time. This can, for example, be used to document video installations with multiple screens and allows playing back synchronized combinations of musical voices and audio tracks. The play tool displays an image which can be clicked and functions as play and pause button. Clicking the image will start the playback of the selected audio and video files. While playing the tool another image will be displayed instead. Clicking this image will pause the players.</p>
<h3 id="media-1">Media</h3>
<p>In the media tab one can upload two image files. One image will be the play­-placeholder, i.e.clicking the image will initiate the playback of the selected files. The other image will be the pause­-placeholder, i.e. clicking this image will pause the selected audio and video files on the weave.</p>
<h3 id="options-7">Options</h3>
<p>In the options tab one can select from among all audio and video files on the weave. These must have been uploaded first with the audio and video tools. The selected files will be controlled with the play tool. The option “pause other players when playing” will ensure that only the selected media files will be played back.</p>
<h2 id="shape-tool">Shape Tool</h2>
<p>The Shape tool is designed for placing simple graphic elements such as arrows and lines in your exposition. You can generate forms to structure your layout or to help navigation. You can create rectangles, circles and lines. You can choose if they’re filled or not. You also have the possibility to specify the thickness of the frame and control the opacity of the elements. There are also four types of arrows (left, right, up, down). You can resize the elements on the weave by resizing the green frame displayed around the shape. By clicking and dragging the yellow point you can rotate an element.</p>
<h2 id="note-tool">Note Tool</h2>
<p>The note tool allows you to organize your work on RC, comment on sections, and communicate with co-authors. Drag the note icon from the tool-pallett onto the weave. You can write directly into the note without opening a new edit-window. Each note has a time-stamp which is generated when the note is placed on the weave.</p>
<p>It is possible to define who is responsible for the content (a change or revision, correction) of the note and you can set a date for resolving the issue described in the note.</p>
<p>Notes are visible on the preview as well. Please check, that all notes have been removed from the exposition when you intend to share or publish it.</p>
<h3 id="notes-and-user-roles">Notes and User Roles</h3>
<p>If an exposition is submitted to a portal the notes created by the different users involved (authors, portal admins, editor, reviewers) have different visibilities. Notes left by the author are visible to the admin and to the editor. Notes left by the reviewer are visible to the admin (though not the author or editor) and notes left to the editor are visible to the author and admin (though not to the review).</p>
<h3 id="text-style-options">Text Style Options</h3>
<p>You can use the buttons to directly add the basic stylings, eg. highlight it with bold or italic font or structure it with numerations or lists. You can change the font-family and increase or decrease the indentation. You can also insert links.</p>
<h3 id="history-1">History</h3>
<p>“History” provides a log of all changes that have been made to the tool. If you have unintentionally deleted a tool, you can restore it using “restore deleted tools” in the commands.</p>
<h2 id="embed-tool">Embed tool</h2>
<p>The embed tool allows the integration of external content, such as videos or sounds, into RC expositions. Currently, the RC supports the following external content providers: <a href="https://www.zhdk.ch/madek">Madek</a>, Youtube, Vimeo, Soundcloud and Sketchfab.</p>
<p>The embed tool can be used by pasting the link from the page you want to embed in the URL field and clicking submit twice. The first submit initiates the processing of the link. How to retrieve the correct embedding link depends on the service. The main URL visible when opening the media content that is to be embedded can be used by the RC for the above mentioned services. Please contact <a href="mailto:support@researchcatalogue.net">support</a> if you have trouble or questions regarding the necessary URL.</p>
<p>Content from Youtube and Soundcloud can be used in the play tool and the playback can be synchronized with native RC tools.</p>
<p>Content from Madek needs to have been made publicly visible before embedding is possible. Please copy the sharing link from Madek into the URL field of the embed tool.</p>
<p>Important: Some RC-based journals/portals do not allow the use of externally hosted materials. If you are making an exposition to be published in such a portal, please check their policy first.</p>
<!-- ## Object Viewer

The object viewer tool is a designed for displaying three-dimensional
images. Is is based on the
[3DNP library](http://thoro.de/page/3dnp-introduction-en "3dnp").  By
dragging the object with the mouse cursor it can rotated around two
axis, i.e. the object can be turned around its centre and tilted back
and forth.  It is necessary to upload a series of images as a zip
file. These images need to be numbered (i.e. image001.jpg,
image002.jpg etc). Each image must the object from a different
angle. You can imagine the creation of the images as the following
process: the object rotates around a vertical axis in a number of
steps, then moving slightly around a horizontal axis and rotating
around the vertical axis in a number of steps again. This is repeated
until an image of every combination of vertical and horizontal
positions has been created. The number of different angles (steps of
rotation around the horizontal axis) is defined by the setting
"levels" in the dialog window. The number of steps of the rotation
around the vertical axis is implicitly defined by "levels" and the
total number of images. -->
<h2 id="style-options">Style Options</h2>
<figure>
<img src="images/style-tab.png" title="the style tab of an html tool" alt="image showing the style tab of an html tool" /><figcaption>image showing the style tab of an html tool</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The style tab allows you to set the way a tool looks on the outside. There are two ways of reaching the style tab:</p>
<ul>
<li>hoovering with your mouse over the tool</li>
<li>click ☰ -&gt; <strong>edit</strong>.</li>
<li>open <strong>style</strong> tab in the dialog.</li>
</ul>
<p>For all tools except the simple text tool, one can also open style:</p>
<ul>
<li>by double clicking on a tool in the editor</li>
<li>click <strong>style</strong> in the tabbar</li>
</ul>
<p>Click on the small “&gt;” to open one of these sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>position</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>left &amp; top</strong> : set the position of the tool in pixels.</li>
<li><strong>width &amp; height</strong> : set the dimensions of the tool in pixels. Image, pdf, video, audio tools will keep their aspect ratio fixed.</li>
<li><strong>rotation</strong> : set the overal rotation of the tool. You can also change the rotation in the editor directly by dragging it by its yellow dot.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>padding</strong> : this adds spacing inside of the border box defined by width and height. This means adding padding will not increase the size of the tool.</li>
<li><strong>border</strong> : make the border defined by width and height visible.
<ul>
<li><em>style</em> : choose a certain visual style of the border (solid, dashed, dotted etc..)</li>
<li><em>strength</em> : set the width of the border in pixels</li>
<li><em>color</em> : set the color</li>
<li><em>radius</em> : this creates rounded corners, with a radius defined in pixels <a id="style-shadow"></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>shadow</strong> : this creates a shadow behind the box defined by <strong>width</strong> &amp; <strong>height</strong>. This can be used to create the illusion of depth.
<ul>
<li><strong>margin-left &amp; margin-right</strong> : this will set the size off the solid part of the shadow.</li>
<li><strong>unschaerfe</strong> : this will set how wide the fuzzy part of the shadow is. You can also use this when margins are 0, resulting in a completely fuzzy shadow around the object.</li>
<li><strong>color</strong> : set the color of the shadow.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>opacity</strong> : smaller values will make the tool more transparent.</li>
</ul>
<p>The style tab only sets the external style of the tool, text markup is done within the text or html tools.</p>
<h3 id="change-tool-defaults">Change tool defaults</h3>
<p>It is possible to change the default styling settings for any tool, by double clicking the tool in the toolbar. After the default is changed, every newly created tool will initially use these new settings.</p>
<h2 id="history-2">History</h2>
<p>The <em>history tab</em> gives you the posibility to change the content <strong>within the tool</strong> to an older version. The versions of a text object are created each time you have clicked outside it (and the three animated dots show inside). With the html tool, a version is created each time you click submit.</p>
<h1 id="graphical-editor---content-manager-tabs">Graphical Editor - Content Manager / Tabs</h1>
<p>The content manager is a collection of tabs located on the right size of the graphical editor.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/media_manage.png" title="media management" alt="media, pages and footnotes tabs" /><figcaption>media, pages and footnotes tabs</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li>overview - all objects in the current weave</li>
<li>media:
<ul>
<li>simple media - all media uploaded in this exposition (including media that is no longer used in the weaves)</li>
<li>sets - sets are folders of media managed by the media repository, you will also find your (old) “works” here.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>pages - a list of all the different pages (pages)</li>
<li>footnotes - a list of rc <a href="#footnotes-and-popovers">footnotes and popovers</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a id="media-management"></a></p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>You can use the overview to see all objects in the exposition as both a miniature map and a list. This can also be useful to retrieve lost objects, or change the ordering (front to back). If you click on a tool in the list, the editor will automatically jump to its location, you can also double click a tool to edit the content of that tool.</p>
<h2 id="media-tab">Media tab</h2>
<p>Media files can be found, uploaded, previewed and deleted in the “Media”-tab on the right hand side. There are subtabs: <strong>Simple Media</strong>, <strong>Sets</strong> and <strong>“+”</strong>, which allows the integration of external repositories, such as the Media Archive of the Arts of the ZHdK (Madek).</p>
<h3 id="simple-media">Simple Media</h3>
<p>The simple media, which can be found within the “Media”-tab on right hand side of the editor. Images, videos, audio and other media that have been added in tools onto the canvas will automatically show up in simple media tab. You can click and drag files from the simple media tab onto your canvas in order to create tools.</p>
<p>You can also upload media here to use it as a background or preview image in tools like the video tool and the pdf tool.</p>
<p>The list of media files can be sorted by type, name, creation date and size and you can search for a file name by using the search field.</p>
<p>Files that are listed in gray are in the process of being transcoded.</p>
<p>There four buttons on top of the list of files, from left to right:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/media_manage.png" title="image showing the simple media tab" alt="Simple media tab" /><figcaption>Simple media tab</figcaption>

<ul>
<li>Upload a file</li>
<li>Preview a file</li>
<li>Edit meta-data of the file</li>
<li>Permanently delete a file from the RC (use with care)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each media file can be provided with a license, see <a href="#licenses">licenses</a>. The licenses of all used media in an exposition are shown on the META page.</p>
<h3 id="sets">Sets</h3>
<p>You can view the media sets you created in the Media Repository. You have to click on the set to open and view the media. Once opened, you can drag media onto your page. An icon will indicate if the set is shared to you by others.</p>
<h4 id="works">Works</h4>
<p>“Works” are an older feature similar to media sets, if you had created works in the past you will find them under sets as well.</p>
<h2 id="import-word-documents-using-simple-media-upload">Import Word documents using Simple Media upload</h2>
<p>It is possible to upload docx/odt/LaTeX documents and have the content automatically be turned into HTML tools and image tools.</p>
<p>To convert a document, open the Simple Media Tab and upload it in the “document” section of the upload dialog. It may take a few moments to convert after the upload has reached 100%.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/media-upload-tab.png" title="image showing the media upload button" alt="media upload tab" /><figcaption>media upload tab</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
<img src="images/upload-doc-dialog.png" title="image showing the doc upload section" alt="upload doc dialog" /><figcaption>upload doc dialog</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once converted, the document will show up as a folder within your simple media. You can drag the elements from this folder to their final desired location in the exposition and resize them to the size you desire.</p>
<p>To ensure maximum compatibility with RC fonts and styling, text-editor specific styling is automatically filtered, but the inner structure of the text is maintained. This includes: paragraphs, headers, bold, italics, footnotes, illustrations &amp; tables. Footnotes are also converted into RC Footnotes/Popovers. Afterwards, one can use raw CSS (also see below for more details) to add styling again, without the need to style each structural element individually. It may thus still be necessary to import certain elements by hand after the import.</p>
<p>The document is split at illustrations, or after a significant amount of text. This to avoid extremely long text tools, which result in problems between browsers and are harder to handle in the graphical editor. The splitting should also make it easier to restructure the document a bit to a more fitting layout to the RC. Because of the graphic and non-linear nature of RC expositions, a 1 on 1 import does not make so much sense. If your documentation requires a more traditional text-based layout (think article/blog post), it may be better to use the text-based editor, which also supports importing from external text editors.</p>
<h3 id="important-note-regarding-styling">Important note regarding styling:</h3>
<p>By default, RC has zero margin on all paragraphs, this will mean that there is no whitespace between paragraphs. To avoid this issue, I recommend adding the following style to your <a href="#page-settings---style" title="link to page settings docs">raw CSS</a> settings of your page where you import word content. You can edit the “raw css” of a page by opening <strong>pages tab</strong> &gt; ✎ <strong>edit settings</strong> &gt; <strong>style</strong> &gt; <strong>raw css</strong>.</p>
<pre>
#container-weave .html-text-editor-content p {
    margin: 1em 0; /* set top and bottom margin to 1 */ }

#container-editor .html-text-editor-content p {
    margin: 1em 0; /* do the same for the editor */ } </pre>
<p>This makes sure paragraph margins are displayed correctly.</p>
<h2 id="pages">Pages</h2>
<p>Pages are managed in the <strong>pages</strong> tab of the content manager. An RC exposition can consist of one or more pages. A new exposition starts with a single page, called “default page”.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/pages-tab-2018.png" title="image showing the page tab" alt="page tab" /><figcaption>page tab</figcaption>

<h3 id="creating-a-page">Creating a page</h3>
<p>New pages are by default <em>private</em>, they have to be explicitely added to the <a href="#table-of-content" title="table of content">table of content</a> to be visible (or by making a <a href="#hyperlinking">hyperlink</a> to the page in your own content). The order of pages cannot be changed in the pages list, but it can in the table of contents. The page will automatically change size based on the content.</p>
<h3 id="entry-page">Entry page</h3>
<p>One can change the first page visible to the reader by changing the <strong>entry page</strong>. Go to the menu <strong>options</strong> and choose <strong>edit meta data</strong>. Scroll down to <strong>“entry page”</strong> (at the bottom of the dialog) and select the page you want as your start page for the reader. <!--
This should be in table of contents, it is completely out of place in
meta-data --></p>
<h2 id="page-settings">Page settings</h2>
<p><img src="images/pages-tab-2018.png" title="image showing the page settings" alt="the page settings dialog" />]</p>
<p>In the page settings dialog, you can change the meta data of the page and control the appearance. It is opened by clicking the pencil button in the bar.</p>
<h3 id="page-settings---meta-title-description-and-iframe-field">Page settings - Meta : title, description and iframe field</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Page title</strong> Set a title for the page. This title can be overriden in the <a href="#table-of-content">table of content</a>, so the reader sees a different one. This can be useful if you need to keep track of different versions of pages.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Description</strong> The description is for personal reference and only visible to the author and collaborators on the exposition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Iframe field</strong> Replace the entire page by an external website by means of a URL. There are a few requirements to the URL for this to work:</p>
<ul>
<li>For reasons of security, the website needs to be configured to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS%20%22https%20on%20wikipedia%22">TLS connection</a>. Links with TLS enabled can in most cases be identified by the <strong>https://</strong> instead of <strong>http://</strong> at the start.</li>
<li>You need to provide the full URL (inlude the https:// at the start).</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that if a correct iFrame url is provided, the entire weave within the exposition is replaced by that website, so any tools and page styling present in the workspace will no longer be visible to the reader.</p>
<p>If you want to combine external content with tools you should use the <a href="#embed-tool">embed tool</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="page-settings---style">Page settings - Style</h3>
<p>Here one can change:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>margin</strong>: If set, it will make the exposition as if is seen through a smaller window.</li>
<li><strong>padding</strong>: Padd extra space on the content itself (for example if you set top and left to 100, it will create extra space on the top and left). In other words, this makes the exposition canvas itself larger.</li>
<li><strong>background</strong>: change the color or set an image as background.</li>
<li><strong>links</strong>: change the default color for all hyperlinks within the page. One can set seperate colors for links the user visited.</li>
<li><strong>footnote</strong>: The color of footnote/popover links same as links, but then for links of footnotes/popovers.</li>
<li><strong>raw css</strong>: apple your own CSS rules to the page, see below</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="raw-css">raw CSS</h2>
<p>You can set user defined <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/" title="css tutorial">CSS</a> rules that are applied to the whole page. Cascading Style Sheets are the standard way of styling HTML documents. Although most styling can be directly edited through the style tab, it can sometimes be useful to specify your own CSS.</p>
<p>The CSS class for HTML tools is:</p>
<pre><code>.html-text-editor-content {
/* put your styles here */
}</code></pre>
<p>To style text within a simple text tool you have to use:</p>
<pre><code>.tool-simpletext .tool-content * {
/* put your style here */   
}</code></pre>
<h3 id="supplying-your-own-fonts">Supplying your own fonts</h3>
<p>You can include your own external fonts through CSS <span class="citation" data-cites="import">@import</span> statements. Be aware that many (also fonts like “Arial”), cannot be self-hosted unless you have a license that allows that. Google Fonts has an overview of fonts that you can freely use. Here is an example of using the “Roboto” font:</p>
<pre><code>@import url(&#39;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:ital@1&amp;display=swap&#39;);

.html-text-editor-content * {
    font-family: roboto;
}

.tool-simpletext .tool-content * {
    font-family: roboto;
}</code></pre>
<h3 id="line-height">Line-height</h3>
<p>There is no way to control line height within the HTML or text tool, but you can change it using CSS:</p>
<pre><code>.html-text-editor-content * {
    line-height: 2em;
}

.tool-simpletext .tool-content * {
    line-height: 2em;
}</code></pre>
<p>“em” is a relative size unit, it measures the line-height ratio from the size of the ‘m’ character in the font.</p>
<p>Be aware that changing the CSS</p>
<h3 id="deleting-a-page">Deleting a page</h3>
<p>The page can be deleted by clicking the trashcan icon next to the page title. Deleted pages cannot be recovered. Of course, if you want to make a page invisible to the reader it may be prefered to just remove it from the <a href="#table-of-content" title="table of content">table of content</a>.</p>
<p><a id="footnotes-and-popovers"></a></p>
<h1 id="graphical-editor---footnotes-and-popovers">Graphical Editor - Footnotes and Popovers</h1>
<p>It is possible to create footnotes and popover weaves in the text, HTML and picture tools. The terms “footnote” and “popover” are used almost interchangeably here. Footnote, however, refers rather to the textual concept of a footnote, i.e. a particular use of the functionality explained in this section, whereas popover is used when referring specifically to the appearing popover window. (There is a tutorial video explaining the footnote workflow on the <a href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/273532/273533">RC Video Tutorials page</a>) These are displayed when the RC user reading the exposition clicks the footnote link or, depending on the settings, when he or she mouse the mouse pointer over the link. This functionality makes it possible to create footnotes in texts, but also create popovers of any size containing RC objects of any type. There are a number of different ways of creating footnotes.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-simple-text-footnote">Creating a Simple Text Footnote</h2>
<p>In order to create a footnote in the text or HTML tool one selects some text, which will be the footnote link and clicks the “Insert/Edit Link or Footnote” menu item (see image).</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/footnotes_sel.png" alt="Selecting text as a footnote link" /><figcaption>Selecting text as a footnote link</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A new footnote can be created by using the left tab in the appearing dialog window. In this window one can set:</p>
<ul>
<li>The title of the footnote.</li>
<li>Whether the popover will be shown when the link is clicked or on mouseover (“View on”).</li>
<li>Where the popover will be displayed with reference to the link or the screen in case of the last option (“screen center”).</li>
<li>Whether the background (i.e. the rest of the exposition) will be darkened when the popover is being shown.</li>
<li>The type of the popover. This can be:
<ul>
<li>A new popover.</li>
<li>The copy of an existing popover.</li>
<li>A simple text popover. A small text box appears which facilitates the creation of footnotes and other popovers containing only a short amount of text. The text can be entered here directly upon creation without the need to further edit the popover and adjust its size. <img src="images/footnote_dia.png" alt="Footnote dialog window" /></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, click “Add Footnote” to confirm and create the footnote, which will subsequently appear in the list of footnotes on the left side of the screen.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/footnote_preview.png" alt="Preview of a footnote" /><figcaption>Preview of a footnote</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="editing-a-footnote">Editing a Footnote</h2>
<p>All footnotes are listed in the “Footnotes” tab on the right hand side.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/footnotes_list_new.png" alt="List of footnotes" /><figcaption>List of footnotes</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are three icons displayed on the top of the list. The first icon opens the footnote workspace editor where you can edit the content of the footnote, the second icon opens a window which allows editing the title, size, and styling of the footnote. One can leave the footnote weave editor by clicking the link “back to main weave” displayed to the left of the main tab. (see image).</p>
<p><strong>“simple text”</strong> footnotes are in fact automatically generated normal footnotes with your text inserted in a text tool. This has consequences if you want to adjust the size of a <strong>“simple text”</strong> footnote as a whole, since you would also need to change the size of the tool within that footnote after resizing. To edit a “simple text” footnote internal tools, simply double click it in the footnote list.</p>
<p>When you are done editing: you can return to your main weave through the link in the top of the editor.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/footnote_back.png" alt="Back to main weave link" /><figcaption>Back to main weave link</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="changing-the-position-or-display-settings-of-a-footnote">Changing the position or display settings of a footnote</h3>
<p>If you need to change the screen position or display settings of an existing footnote, the best way is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to the Footnote tab.</li>
<li>Click the little blanc page icon next to the footnote you want to change.</li>
<li>Go to the settings tab</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="auto-numbered-footnotes">Auto-Numbered Footnotes</h3>
<p>Instead of using text as footnote links it is also possible to use numbered links. The numbers will be filled in and adjusted automatically. In order to create auto-numbered footnotes create a footnote in the text or HTML tool as described above but without selecting any text. An “x” will be inserted where the cursor is placed. This “x” will be replaced by the correct number when the text is displayed.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/footnote_auto.png" alt="Auto-numbered footnote in the editor" /><figcaption>Auto-numbered footnote in the editor</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The numbering starts at 1 and encompasses all text and HTML objects on the weave. Numbering is performed by object and proceeds from the top and left to the bottom and right of the page.</p>
<p>Be aware that automatic numbering does not depend on creation order, it only depends on x and y position of the tools. This means that if the notes (1,2, 3 etc..) are in a vertical column, for example:</p>
<figure>
<img class="portrait-image" src="images/footnotes_align_correct.png" title="image demonstrating incorrect allignment will result in incorrect numbering" alt="">
<figcaption>
Footnote numbering in correctly vertically-aligned tools
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When the tools are lined up like this, footnotes are correctly numbered. However, if one of the text tools containing an automatic footnote in a column is just a bit (even 1 pixel) to the left, like so (exaggeration):</p>
<figure>
<img class="portrait-image" src="images/footnotes_alignment.png" title="image demonstrating incorrect allignment will result in incorrect numbering" alt="">
<figcaption>
Incorrect auto-numbering in non-aligned tools
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Then rc will automatically number the notes in 2 first than 1 than 3. So in this case, it is very important to have the text tools exactly at the same x position (through right click -&gt; style tab you can check this most easily).</p>
<h3 id="pictures">Pictures</h3>
<p>It is also possible to use images as links to footnotes. When clicking on the image or moving over it with the mouse cursor the popover will be show. In order to use an image as a footnote click the menu icon on the bottom right of the image (or right click the image) in order to open the context menu. Click the item “add footnote” from the context menu and fill in the appearing dialog window.</p>
<p><a id="table-of-content"></a></p>
<h1 id="graphical-expositions---table-of-content">Graphical Expositions - Table of Content</h1>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/273532/273533/54/759">video tutorial</a> on this topic.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/table-of-content-example.png" alt="an example of a contents list, made through the table of content" /><figcaption>an example of a contents list, made through the table of content</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The table of content is designed to facilitate the navigation through an exposition. Both pages and locations within a page can be added in the table of content. In order to edit the table of content, go to the <strong>“Options”</strong> menu &gt; <strong>“Edit Table of Content”</strong>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/table-of-content-dialog.png" alt="Table of content dialog" /><figcaption>Table of content dialog</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To make a new entry, click on the index number and select the page (or “weave”) from the drop down menu and click submit.</p>
<p>There are two optional fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Title</strong><br />
Specify a custom name for this entry to be used within the contents menu. If left empty, it uses the title from the editor.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>X-COORD &amp; Y-COORD</strong><br />
you can use this to create an entry that has an offset, which immediately opens the page on a specific location within the exposition. The X,Y values correspond to an offset in pixels. The Y offset is measured from the top. Instead of looking these values up by hand, you may also use <a href="#set-default-position-show-current-position"><strong>commands -&gt; show current position</strong></a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Tip: you can easily reorder the table of contents entries by clicking and dragging the boxes.</em></p>
<h3 id="static-navigation-bar">Static navigation bar</h3>
<p>At the bottom of the <strong>table of content</strong> dialog, there is an option <strong>static menu bar</strong> to display the navigation bar continuously (instead of it automatically hiding).</p>
<h3 id="toc-alignment">TOC alignment</h3>
<p>Choose wether the links in the content menu should be displayed <em>horizontally</em> or <em>vertically</em>.</p>
<h2 id="hyperlinking">Hyperlinking</h2>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/273532/273533">video tutorial</a> on this topic.</p>
<p>It is possible to create hyperlinks between pages (or “weaves”) of an exposition and within a single page. This process exists of two steps: fetch the link and creating the hyperlink.</p>
<p>In order to fetch a link to a different page within your exposition:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>open the page you want to link <strong>to</strong> in the editor (through the page tab on the right hand side).</li>
<li><em>(optional)</em> scroll the page to the position where you want the link to point to.</li>
<li>go to <strong>options-&gt;show current position</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This will display a URL of the target page with the current scroll location. Copy the URL into the clipboard (Ctrl-C/Cmd-C).</p>
<p>Now to turn a piece of text into a hyperlink:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create or open a <a href="#text-tool">Text</a> or <a href="#HTML-tool">HTML tool</a> and select a word or sentence that should become the link.</li>
<li>Now click the hyperlink button (it looks like a chain link) and a dialog will be displayed. <img src="images/html-hyperlink.png" alt="location of the hyperlink button in text tool" /> <img src="images/text-hyperlink.png" alt="location of the hyperlink button in the html tool" /></li>
<li>Paste the link in the <strong>link URL</strong> field and click <strong>add link</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<figure>
<img src="images/hyperlink-dialog.png" alt="Hyperlink dialog window" /><figcaption>Hyperlink dialog window</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="dialog-options">Dialog options:</h3>
<p>Within the hyperlink dialog there are a couple of options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Link URL</strong> : here you can type or paste a link</li>
<li><strong>Target</strong> : control wether the link will open in a new screen or not.</li>
<li><strong>Title</strong> : change the title of the link</li>
<li><strong>Class</strong> : set the class of the link (this is rarely used)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="overview-1">Overview</h2>
<p>Within the “Commands” tab on the right-hand side of the editor there is a checkbox labeled “Overview.” Clicking the checkbox will open and close a tab on the right-hand side of the editor. It contains both a map and a list of all objects in the exposition.</p>
<p>The overview map outlines all tools on the page, their size and position. By moving the red rectangle, one can jump to a specific position on the page.</p>
<p>Below the overview map, there is a list of all objects. If you click one of these tools, you go directly to that tools location. This can also be very useful when trying to find tools that have somehow become hidden, for example if another tool has been placed on top.</p>

<li>copy - ctrl + C</li>
<li>paste - ctrl + V</li>
<li>duplicate - ctrl + D</li>
<li>delete - delete (Apple: fn + backspace) (ctrl = cmd on Mac computers)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Order functions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>bring to front</li>
<li>bring to back</li>
</ul>
<p>These options change the order of objects if they overlap. Order can be important if you have tools with controls: for example, an audio player that is behind a text tool would need to be in front to allow the user to click the play button on it.</p>
<p><strong>Locking:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>lock</li>
<li>unlock</li>
</ul>
<p>Locking an object means it cannot be changed or moved in any way (until it is unlocked). This feature can also be used if only part of the exposition is to be moved (by locking the objects you do not want to move).</p>
<h2 id="arrange-menu">Arrange menu</h2>
<p>These functions help with aligning (two or more) tools. To select multiple tools, click them one by one while holding ctrl/cmd key, then choose the function you want to apply from the arrange menu.</p>
<p><span style="red"> (!) Be careful when applying to many tools at once on a complex weave. The changes in position are not reversable (unless you copied the tools before). </span></p>
<ul>
<li>left edges: all left sides will be aligned (to the last tool you selected)</li>
<li>right edges: all right sides will be aligned</li>
<li>top : all top sides will be aligned</li>
<li>bottom : all bottom sides will be aligned</li>
<li>center on vertical axis : the tools will all be centered around one vertical line (like centered text !)</li>
<li>center on horizontal axis : the horizontal middle of the tools will al be on the same horizontal line</li>
<li>distribute left edges equally: the left and rightmost tool stay in the same place, equally space the left sides of the tools in between</li>
<li>distribute top edges equally: the top and bottom tool stay the same, equally space the top sides of the tools in between</li>
<li>make vertical gaps equal: the gaps between tools are all made the same (by dividing the sum of gaps equally)</li>
<li>make horizontal gaps equal: the horizontal gaps between tools are made equal.</li>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The text-based editor is aimed at creating <a href="http://https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_webdesign">responsive</a> RC expositions. Despite the “text” in the name, expositions made with this editor can also contain images, video, audio or PDF. “Text based” refers to the method of editing: through plain text. Because of this plain text input, text-based expositions can be easily imported or edited in external editors. The consequence is that editing the visual layout is less direct as in the graphical based editor. The structure of the exposition is expressed by using Markdown, the display of which can be customized through style sheets (css).</p>
<p>On desktop, the editor splits the screen in two: you can write your text on the left side <a href="#editor">editor</a> while the result is shown as a <a href="#preview">preview</a> on the right hand side. It is also possible to <a href="#import-export">import</a> the text from external formats like Word and Open Office. Formatting (<strong>bold</strong>,<em>italic</em> etc…) is added using <a
href="#markdown">markdown</a> notation.</p>
<p>If you want to insert <a href="#introduction" title="video, audio, image or PDF">media</a>, you can add these through the <a href="#upload-media"><strong>“upload media”</strong> button </a>. When the upload has finished, the media edit dialog will automatically open, allowing you to edit and insert it.</p>
<p>Finally, the look of your text and media can be controlled through the media list and the style editor.</p>
<h2 id="creation-and-using-a-template">Creation and using a template</h2>
<p>To create a text-based exposition, go to “my profile” and click <a href="#create-exposition">create exposition</a>, then select “text-based” for the editor type. Additionally, you can select a template, which will mean your new exposition will be pre-filled with the stylesheet and, depending on the template, some placeholder text.</p>
<p>Because the text-based and graphical formats are completely different, you can only change the editor type the moment you create a new exposition.</p>
<p>Portal admins can select any of their own expositions to become a template for their portal users, by going to the “template” tab in their <a href="#portal-settings-screen">portal settings</a>.</p>
<h2 id="editor">Editor</h2>
<p>The left hand side is where you can edit your text. The editor uses <a href="#markdown" title="link to markdown docs">Markdown</a>, which is a lightweight, human-friendly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language">markup language</a>. Because Markdown is expressed as plain text, you cannot directly change the styling of the text (font-size, color etc.. are edited in <a href="#edit-style">style</a> ), but you can express the structure/markup of your text. See <a href="#markdown" title="more about markdown">Markdown</a> for a brief overview.</p>
<p>By default the editor uses colors to show the Markdown elements in your text, but you can also choose “plain txt” which allows your browsers spellchecker to work. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<h2 id="previews">Previews</h2>
<p>Here you can see a preview of your exposition.</p>
<p>Because text based expositions are responsive (react to the size of the window), the result may change based on the width of the screen. For a full view preview, use the eye button in the toolbar.</p>
<h3 id="upload-media">Upload media</h3>
<p>To add new media, click upload media. After the upload finishes, the media edit dialog opens. This allow you to edit its metadata, size and to insert the media at the current cursor position.</p>
<p>If you want to insert previously used media, you can use the “media button” in the <a href="#toolbar">toolbar</a>.</p>
<h2 id="media-list">Media list</h2>
<p>All media that you uploaded will appear in the “media list”, where they can be edited or deleted.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/media-list-elm.png" title="image showing media list" alt="The media list" /><figcaption>The media list</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="editing-media">Editing media</h3>
<p>From within the media-list, if you click [<strong>edit</strong>], you will be able to change the <strong>name</strong>, <strong>metadata</strong> and display of a media file.</p>
<ul>
<li>name (also used for the tag)</li>
<li>change the way the files is displayed (size, float left/right)</li>
<li>add copyright info</li>
<li>choose a license</li>
<li>add description <br><br><br />
Using the buttons in the list itself:</li>
<li>remove the object from your exposition</li>
<li>insert the object in the current position in the text.</li>
</ul>

<img src="images/edit-media-elm.png" title="image showing the edit media dialog" alt="The media edit dialog" /><figcaption>The media edit dialog</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="insert-media">Insert media</h2>
<p>Media is represented on the editor side using a !{<em>media-name</em>} tag. The easiest way of inserting such a media tag is throught the <a href="#insert-toolbar-button">insert media toolbar button</a>, which shows a list of available media that can be inserted. Double click any item to insert.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/insert-media-elm.png" title="inserting media using the insert button" alt="inserting media using the insert button" /><figcaption>inserting media using the insert button</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can also write the media tags directly, for example: to insert a media named “myFile”, you can directly write !{myFile}. This !{myFile} tag will be the location in your text where myFile will be inserted.</p>
<p>A <strong>caption text</strong> can also be included, to get a caption you write [my caption text]{myFile}. The caption text is displayed underneath the media.</p>
<h2 id="import-export">Import &amp; export</h2>
<p>You can import documents from text editors like Word (.docx), Libre/Open Office (.odt), HTML and several other formats. Not all styling is supported but images, footnotes, tables and most other structural features of the text are.</p>
<h2 id="edit-style">Edit style</h2>
<p>Text based expositions are styled using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which is a standard way of styling web documents. The CSS of an exposition can be edited by going to the <strong>style</strong> tab. If you are not familiar with CSS, there is a good introduction here: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/" class="uri">https://www.w3schools.com/css/</a>.</p>
<p>The structure of inserted media is as follows. You can use the outside class (rc-media-123455) to style an individual media element.</p>
<code>
<div class="rcobject small [rcimage/rcpdf/rcvideo/rcaudio] rc-media-[media id]">
<pre><code>&lt;figure id=&quot;media-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;...&quot;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        Caption text, which is taken from the tag -&gt; ![caption text]{media1}
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
<p></code></p>
<p>Most templates will provide some basic formatting already, that you can adjust to your needs.</p>
<h2 id="toolbar">Toolbar</h2>
<p>From left to right:</p>
<ul>
<li>H1, H2 &amp; H3 - insert <a href="#headers">header</a> formatting</li>
<li>B / I - insert <a href="#strong-emphasis"><strong>bold</strong> (strong) and italic (<em>emphasis</em>)</a></li>
<li><img class="icon" src="images/icons/list-unordered.svg" title="icon" alt="list formatting button"> - <a href="#lists">Unordered list / bullet point</a> formatting</li>
<li><img class="icon" src="images/icons/list-ordered.svg" title="icon" alt="list formatting button"> - <a href="#lists">Ordered list / Numbered list</a> formatting</li>
<li><img class="icon" src="images/icons/link-intact.svg" title="icon" alt="hyperlink formatting"> - Insert <a href="#links">hyperlink</a> formatting</li>
<li><img class="icon" src="images/icons/double-quote-sans-left.svg" title="icon" alt="quotation"> - Quotation</li>
<li><strong>*</strong> - Insert <a href="#footnotes">footnote</a> notation</li>
<li><img id="insert-toolbar-button" class="icon" src="images/icons/file-media.svg"> - Insert Media from media list</li>
<li><img class="icon" src="images/icons/undo.svg"> - Undo/Redo</li>
<li>txt - Switch to plain text mode (browser can provide spellchecker in this mode)</li>
<li><img class="icon" src="images/icons/screen-full.svg"> - Fullscreen mode (hides preview)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="markdown">Markdown</h2>
<p>Markdown is a human-friendly way of writing HTML webpages without using code. Markdown is written as plain text (like you would write on a typewriter), that is translated into HTML for you.</p>
<p>By surrounding your words with a few special characters you can inform markdown which styling you want it to use.</p>
<p><a id="strong-emphasis"></p>
<p>For example:<br />
<em>italic</em> = <code>*italic*</code><br />
<strong>bold</strong> = <code>__bold__</code></p>
<p>Instead of typing these characters, you can also select a piece of text and push the desired <strong>style button</strong> on top of the editor. This will insert the correct Markdown notation for you.</p>
<h3 id="paragraphs">Paragraphs</h3>
<p>When two blocks of text are separated by an empty line, it starts a new paragraph.</p>
<p><strong>example a)</strong> <strong>an empty line starts a new paragraph:</strong></p>
<pre>
a paragraph
some text
and some other text

<p><strong>example b)</strong> <strong>if lines are not separated by an empty line, they are combined:</strong></p>
<pre>
This text 
will be joined together
</pre>
<p><em>results in:</em></p>
<p><span class="bg-red">This text </span><span class="bg-blue">will be joined together</span></p>
<p><strong>You can force a newline by:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>putting two spaces at the end of a line</li>
<li>putting an <code>\</code> character at the end of a line</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>example c)</strong> <strong>two spaces at the end tells markdown to keep the newline</strong></p>
<pre>
This line has two spaces at the end__
and it thus keeps the newline.
</pre>
<p><em>results in:</em></p>
<p><span class="bg-red">This line has two spaces at the end </span><br> <span class="bg-blue">and it thus keeps the newline.</span></p>
<p><strong>example d)</strong> <strong>a newline can also be kept by appending a backslash</strong></p>
<pre> 
The same for the backslash\
also does the trick!
</pre>
<p><em>results in:</em></p>
<p><span class="bg-red">The same for the backslash </span> <br> <span class="bg-blue">also does the trick!</span></p>
<h3 id="headers">Headers</h3>
<p>Headers are defined by using one or more "#" in front of the header name:</p>
<p><code># header 1</code><br> <code>## header 2</code><br> <code>### header 3</code><br></p>
<p>There are six levels of headers. Header level 1, 2 and 3 (<code>#</code>,<code>##</code>,<code>###</code>) are automatically included in the <strong>contents</strong> menu, for easy navigation for the reader.</p>
<p>An alternative way of writing headers is by putting ===== or — below you header text.</p>
<p><code>Header 1</code><br />
<code>========</code></p>
<p><code>Header 2</code><br />
<code>----------</code></p>
<h3 id="lists">Lists</h3>
<p>To get a bullet point list, write * before each item. Before the first item, keep an empty line. Thus, when you write:</p>
<pre><code>* my first point
* another throught
* yet another thought</code></pre>
<p>it will result in</p>
<ul>
<li>a list</li>
<li>which has</li>
<li>three items</li>
</ul>
<p>To get ordered lists, write a number and a point, 1. , 2. , 3.</p>
<pre><code>1. one
2. two 
3. three</code></pre>
<h3 id="links">Links</h3>
<p>Hyperlinks are written in the following manner: <code>[linktext](http://example.com)</code><br />
which results in:<br />
<a href="http://example.com">linktext</a></p>
<p>You can also use create internal links, called <em>anchors</em>. The link is made by writing a hashtag (#) before the name of your anchor:</p>
<p><code>[link](#your-anchor-id)</code></p>
<p>The anchor itself is created like this:</p>
<p><code>&lt;a id="your-anchor-id"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>
<h3 id="footnotes-text-based">Footnotes (text based)</h3>
<p>The easiest way of inserting a footnote is using the footnote button: [ <strong>*</strong> ]. Footnotes consist of two parts, the reference, written like so:</p>
<p><code>[^1]</code></p>
<p>Then you define the footnote content at the bottom of your text with:</p>
<p><code>[^1]: This is my footnote.</code></p>
<p>It’s content is automatically moved to the bottom of the text. The footnote content is automatically moved to the bottom of the resulting text.</p>
<h3 id="quotation">Quotation</h3>
A quotation is inserted by indenting your text with 4 spaces or 1 tab, like so:
<pre>
`    quotation`
`    more quotation`
</pre>
<p>Quotations are not automatically formatted (they keep their newlines).</p>
<h3 id="tables-markdown">Tables (markdown)</h3>
<p>Tables are written like this:</p>
<pre>
| Name    | Age | Species |
|---------|-----|---------|
| Harry   | 23  | Human   |
| Gerhard | 77  | Parrot  |
| Judith  | 6   | Cat     |

<h1 id="html-import">HTML Import</h1>
<p>It is possible to import a website of static HTML into the RC. This feature is aimed at users that are familiar with HTML and want to use their own editor.</p>
<p>For security reasons, JavaScript is not supported, but CSS files, <code>&lt;img&gt; &lt;video&gt; &lt;audio&gt;</code> tags can be used. The folder containing your HTML and media files are to be uploaded as a zip file (.zip).</p>
<p><em>Important: at this moment, the existing RC Journals do not accept submissions imported as HTML, because they do not fit in existing reviewing/editing workflows. If you are planning to submit your exposition to one of the journals in the RC, one should use the graphical or the text-based editor.</em></p>
<p>To create a HTML based exposition:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Click [ Create Exposition ] on your profile page.</li>
<li>Select “html based” as the editor, fill in required metadata fields and click submit.</li>
</ol>

</figure>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>Wait for upload to finish</p>
<p>When the upload finished and there is no error, you can view the exposition by clicking the preview button (eye in the top right corner). If it is not succesful you can use the error message to see what changes you may need to make and try again.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="requirements-for-html-expositions">Requirements for HTML expositions</h3>
<p>There are a few requirements to the zip that is uploaded:</p>
<ul>
<li>The root folder needs to contain a file named index.html, this will be the page where the exposition opens.</li>
<li>All other HTML files in the root folder will be added to the table of contents.</li>
<li>Do not nest folders into folders.</li>
<li>You can use .html .css and various media formats, mp4, mp3 etc.. The RC will automatically transcode the video and audio to a web compatible format.</li>
<li>JavaScript is currently not supported for security reasons, if present, import will fail.</li>
<li>The character encoding of the .html files should be UTF-8</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-exposition">Example exposition</h3>
<p>An example HTML-based exposition can be downloaded here:<br />

<h3 id="updating">Updating</h3>
<p>Currently, it is not possible to update single files within your uploaded exposition. When something changes, you will have to upload the whole exposition again.</p>

<h1 id="navigation">Navigation</h1>
<h2 id="navigation-bar">Navigation bar</h2>
<p>When one moves the mouse cursor to the top of an exposition, a menu bar appears.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/navigation-bar.png" title="image showing the navigation bar" alt="the RC navigation bar" /><figcaption>the RC navigation bar</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The navigation bar contains, from left to right:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Content</strong><br />
This contains the table of contents and links to the authors. Please see the help section on <a href="#table-of-content">table of contents</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Navigation</strong> (graphical expositions only)<br />
Navigation is a graphical map of all the exposition’s content on the current weave. You can click it to jump to a location.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Abstract</strong><br />
Abstract, this can be changed by clicking title in the editor or ☰ &gt; <strong>edit details</strong> on your profile.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Title / citation info</strong><br />
By moving the mouse pointer the title of your research, a little window with citation info will appear. The link (URL) of the current page is shown, including the current scrolling location. This URL can thus be used to generate the <a href="#hyperlinks">hyperlink</a> for internal linking. You can also use this link to cite a specific location within an exposition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Meta</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Takes you to the metadata page, which shows the full set of metadata related to the exposition: author(s), keywords, abstract, creation date, publication date and copyright &amp; licenses of all used media files.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reviewing</strong> (graphical expositions only)<br />
Reviewing is connected to the note tool (the yellow “post-it” notes) and is intended for the communication between the author(s) and the reviewer during the reviewing-process. This option is only available for expositions that have not been published yet. Notes can also be used for approving expositions in educational contexts.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /> There are a couple of functions available: <br /> - hide notes (hide all notes) - show open notes (show only notes that are open) - show resolved notes (show the resolved notes) - add new note (open a note tool) - previous note (jump to previous note) - next note (jump to next note)</p>
<h3 id="comments">Comments</h3>
<p>Shows the latest and previous comments on your exposition from the RC community.</p>
<h3 id="terms-of-use">Terms of use</h3>
<p>This displays the terms of as set by the Society for Artistic Research (SAR).</p>
<h1 id="making-expositions-visible-and-working-with-others">Making expositions visible and working with others</h1>
<p>By default, expositions are <strong>private</strong>: only visible to your account. These are the three options to make something visible to others:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#collaborating-on-research">collaborate</a>: invite individual RC users to view, comment or edit your exposition.</li>
<li><a href="#share">share</a>: make your research visible to other people, but you can still change the content or make it private again. Others will not be able to edit.</li>
<li><a href="#publication">publishing</a>: self-publish, or request publication within one of the portals. You cannot edit the content after publication.</li>
</ul>
<p class="red">
An important feature of <strong>publication</strong> in the RC, is that it is <strong>permanent</strong>. This means that once an exposition is published, content will be locked forever. The idea behind this, is that the content of published expositions can be safely referenced by others, without risk of linking to something that has changed or dissapeared.
</p>
<h2 id="collaborating-on-research">Collaborating on Research</h2>
<p>The Research Catalogue allows you to work together on a research exposition with mulltiple users. This is called collaboration.</p>
<p>There are 3 types of collaborators:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>co-author</em> : the collaborator is considered a co-author of the research and will be shown in the author list of the research exposition.</li>
<li><em>contributor</em> : this type of collaborator has the same rights but won’t feature as co-author of your exposition. An example of a contributor might be a graphical designer helping with the layout of your exposition without having any involvement with the research itself.</li>
<li><em>supervisor</em> : can view an exposition and leave comments. The supervisor will also be mentioned in the metadata.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="adding-a-collaborator">Adding a Collaborator</h3>
<p>An author of an exposition can invite collaborators through the collaboration tab of the exposition: click the <strong>menu icon</strong> (1) and <strong>‘edit details’</strong> (2) next to the research on your profile. If you are already in the workspace editor, you can also click on the title of your research at the top of the editor.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/collaborate_1.png" title="image showing the menu icon" alt="Location of the collaboration dialog" /><figcaption>Location of the collaboration dialog</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Choose <strong>‘collaboration’</strong>, search for the user you want to cooperate with and add her or him by clicking on their name.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/inviting-supervisor.png" title="Image showing a user adding another user as supervisor" alt="Inviting a supervisor by typing it into the supervisor box" /><figcaption>Inviting a supervisor by typing it into the supervisor box</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The users that were added will show up as a list below the field. After clicking submit, collaborators will receive an invitation from you in their message-box which they can accept or decline. When accepting the invitation, the collaborator will have access to your exposition workspace and he will be able to edit it.</p>
<h3 id="removing-a-collaborator">Removing a Collaborator</h3>
<p>If you want to remove a collaborator, click the “x” behind their name in the field they were added. If you remove a supervisor, the supervisor will receive a request to remove them (they have to approve the removal).</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/collaborate_2.png" title="Collaboration tab" alt="Collaboration tab" /><figcaption>Collaboration tab</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Note: If a users name in the list is enclosed in brackets ( [ name ] ), it means that the invitation is sent successfully, but has not been accepted yet by the receiver.</p>
<h3 id="communication-with-collaborators">Communication with Collaborators</h3>
<p>While collaborating on an exposition, there are several ways of communicating with each other</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Using the note tool</strong> Notes are the RC equivalent of yellow post it notes. You can simply drag one from the toolbar onto the exposition workspace. See also the note tool help.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Send collaboration message</strong> You can send a direct text message to your collaborator using the <em>Send collaboration message</em> found under the <strong>commands</strong>_ tab.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Posting a comment</strong> In expositions where you are not a collaborator, you can still leave comments by going to the top bar of the exposition and clicking the <strong>Comments</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<!-- TODO: Insert links to other parts of the documentation -->
<p><a id="publishing-and-sharing"></a></p>
<p>Instead of collaborating with RC users you can also <a href="#publish"><strong>publish</strong></a> an exposition or <a href="#share"><strong>share</strong></a> share it with groups of people. The difference is when an exposition is <strong>shared</strong>, content can still be changed, and the mode of sharing can be changed at a later point.</p>
<h2 id="share">Share</h2>
<p><strong>Share</strong> option can used to control visibility of works and expositions for groups of people. By default, your expositions are <strong>private</strong>, changing the mode allows others to see your work. Unlike <strong>publishing</strong>, you will still be able to change the content of an exposition when it is shared.</p>
<p>The share option can be found under the object menu (<img
class="tiny_icon" src="images/menu.png" alt="hamburger menu icon">) of each object on your profile.</p>
<p>There are four modes of sharing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>private</strong> (<strong>default</strong>) : only visible to you or the <a href="#collaborating-on-research" title="collaboration">collaborators</a> on that specific object.</li>
<li><strong>only RC users</strong> : visible to users with an RC account.</li>
<li><strong>limited to portal</strong>: visible only to members of a certain portal within RC. Clicking a portal in the list below, toggles visibity of your exposition for members of that portal. If required, you can also select multiple.</li>
<li><strong>public</strong> : visible to anyone on the internet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Independent of the above choices there is a check box:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>link share</strong> : The object is accessible through a “secret” link. Only people that have the link can view the object. This is useful for sharing with readers without an RC account, by turning the option on and mailing them the link.</li>
</ul>
<p>Link share can be combined with any of the other sharing modes (private, RC users, limited to portal, public). An exposition can for example be shared within a portal but simultaniously be accessible through the “secret” link.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/sharing-options.png" title="image showing sharing options" alt="sharing menu dialog" /><figcaption>sharing menu dialog</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="publication">Publication</h2>
<p><strong>Publication</strong>, is permanent. This means that once an exposition is published, all content will be locked. The idea behind this, is that the content of published expositions can be safely referenced by others, without risk of linking to something that has changed or dissapeared. You can self-publish an exposition, or request publication with one of the portals. Please consult the portal pages: (<a href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/institutions">institutions</a> or <a href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/journals">journals</a>) to see what requirements there are for publication there.</p>
<h3 id="self-publish">Self-Publish</h3>
<p>Self-publishing makes an exposition <strong>no longer editable</strong> and publicly visible. On publication you will get a (free) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier">DOI</a>. By design, publishing an exposition is not reversible (so others can use the exposition link as a reference).</p>
<h3 id="submit-for-publication">Submit for Publication</h3>
<p>Expositions can also be submitted to portals (such as journals) for publication. Most of the institutional portals will only accept requests from within the institution that is associated with it, in case you want to submit to one of those, be sure to check their instructions regarding submissions: (<a href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/institutions">institutions</a> or <a href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/journals">journals</a>).</p>
<p>To request publication within a portal, click ☰ -&gt; submit for publication. You can then select “submit for unlimited publication” and choose the portal to which the request is to be sent. After submitting, the exposition will show “in review” status.</p>
<p>While the exposition is “in review” state it can no longer be edited. The portal admin or editor will contact you regarding the reviewing process. The portal admin can unlock the exposition by putting it “in revision”, or rejecting the publication request. In the first case you or the admin can lock it again, in the second case you will have to resubmit it using the normal method.</p>
<p>After the portal admin accepts the publication request, you will receive a message and the content of the exposition will be premanently locked.</p>
<h3 id="connect-to-portal">Connect to Portal</h3>
<p>An exposition can be connected to a portal without being published by the portal. The portal admin will receive a notification and has to confirm the connection. Once the connection has been approved it will be shown in the object’s metadata and the object may appear on the portal page and portal feeds. Connected works may for example accompany a published exposition or represent a connected event. They have to be at least shared within the portal, private expositions cannot be connected to a portal.</p>
<h1 id="follow-and-search">Follow and Search</h1>
<h3 id="follow">Follow</h3>
<p>It is possible to “follow” other users, portals, and objects such as expositions and works. Once you are logged in you will see “follow” links in the bottom right corner of objects displayed on the front page, other user’s pages and other places on the RC. “Follow” links also appear on user and portal profile pages. Once you follow a user, portal, or object new publications, edits, comments etc. will be displayed on the “FEEDS” page. Clicking the wrench icon opens up a dialog in which you can adjust the precise information you want to see for each user, portal or object you follow.</p>
<h3 id="search">Search</h3>
<p>You can search the RC by using the search field in the top right corner. Moreover you can use the “advanced search” functionality, which allows for filtered searches and and searches according to specific criteria such as object type, keywords, authors, etc.</p>
<p><a id="licences"></a></p>
<h1 id="licenses-1">Licenses</h1>
<p>Authors can choose different licenses for both their expositions and media. A license can help make clear under what conditions you allow your material to be (re)used. All rights reserved is the most strict: it means that people have to get your permission to use any material. The motivation to publish works under a more liberal Creative Commons license, is that it makes it easier for your materials to be used and distributed by others.</p>

<h1 id="administration-reviewing-process">Administration: Reviewing process</h1>
<h2 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a tutorial to describe how an RC Portal can be used for publication workflows. It is aimed at portal administrators. The process typically consists of 4 stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>setting up accounts</li>
<li>writing the content by the author(s), possibly in collaboration with other RC users.</li>
<li>reviewing of the exposition by reviewers</li>
<li>publication</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setting-up-accounts">Setting up accounts</h2>
<p>There are two ways of setting up accounts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The author can create an account for him/her self, by clicking <a href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/register" title="Registration on the Research Catalogue">REGISTER</a> on the research catalogue homepage. After filling in the form the author will immediatly get a basic account. To gain a full account, which has the right to create content, the author will be requisted to send a proof of identity and signed SAR agreement letter.</p></li>
<li><p>The portal admin creates the account(s) for the author(s). This option is common when a large number of users need be created at once. In this case, the responsibility of identification and making sure that the SAR agreement letter is signed lies with the portal administrator creating the account(s). The agreement letter can be found on basecamp or requirested through RC support. Please send the signed agreement letters to RC user support.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The administrator can create accounts by going to the <strong><a href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/admin">admin section</a></strong> and opening the <strong>user</strong> page. Click <strong>+</strong> at the right top corner of the screen. After creating the account, the username (which is an email address) and password can be sent through email. Be sure that in the roles tab, the “basic account” option is turned <strong>off</strong>. This means the user will have a full account and is able to create content.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/user-roles.png" title="Image showing edit user roles dialog" alt="edit user roles dialog" /><figcaption>edit user roles dialog</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For safety, admins creating user accounts should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a unique password for each new user.</li>
<li>Make the password sufficiently random (current standard is at least 12 characters).</li>
</ul>
<p>Safer is to have the student make their own limited account (through normal <a href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/register">registration</a>) and add them to the portal afterwards. Alternatively, you could also generate a long random password and throw it away immediately, then ask the user to reset the password themselves using <a href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/forgotten-password" class="uri">https://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/forgotten-password</a>.</p>
<h2 id="writing-the-exposition-collaboration">Writing the exposition, collaboration</h2>
<p>The next stage is the writing of the <em>exposition</em> itself. It is important to note that it has to be an <em>exposition</em>, a <em>work</em> object on its own cannot enter a review workflow on the RC. <em>Works</em> can however be embedded as part of an exposition to be reviewed &amp; published. The author does not need to be a member of the portal user list in order to make a publication request to it.</p>
<p>During the writing stage, it is common that the exposition in progress is shared with one or more other readers or collaborators. These collaborators can use the notes system to leave feedback. There are three types of collaboration roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>supervisor (no edit permissions, but can leave notes)</li>
<li>co author (full edit permissions)</li>
<li>contributor (full edit permissions, but not mentioned in meta-data)</li>
</ul>
<p>The author can invite RC users to these roles by going to edit details or clicking on the title of their exposition in the workspace editor and choosing “collaboration”. The collaborators will receive an invitation (in RC messages) that has to be accepted before they can start to collaborate.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/collaboration.png" title="Image showing the collabration tab" alt="collaboration tab" /><figcaption>collaboration tab</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="requesting-publication">Requesting publication</h2>
<p>Once the writing is sufficiently progressed, the next step is that the author sents a request to publish the exposition. This is done through the ☰ menu, which is located on the “my profile” in the right bottom corner of the exposition summary. This will open a dialog where he/she can choose to which portal the exposition should be published. Within this dialog the author can also indicate weither the exposition should be published “limited to portal” or “unlimited to portal”. Limited to portal means that when the exposition is published, it is only visible to members of the portal.</p>
<p>Important: the choice by the author is only a suggestion, in the end, it will be the portal admin that decides in which way (limited or unlimited) an exposition is published.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/submit-publication2.png" title="Image showing the publication tab" alt="publication dialog" /><figcaption>publication dialog</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once the author has done this step, no further changes can be made to the exposition by the author. It will be listed on their profile under the status “in review”.</p>
<p>The portal admin will receive a message from the RC that a new work is ready for review. It will also be available under the “reviewing” section in the <strong><a href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/admin">admin section</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The expositions content is locked for the author(s) during the review process, only the portal admin can edit. If the author needs to revision the content, it is possible to temporarely open for editing by clicking the “in revision” button <img
class="icon" src="images/revision-action.png" />. This will open a dialog where you can put the exposition “in revision”. During revision, the exposition will remain listed in the reviewing page. Once the author is done, they can either resubmit themselves from their profile page, or the administrator can use the button in the “reviewing” page to change the status back to “in review”.</p>
<p>If the publication was by accident or to the wrong portal, the publication request can be declined by the portal administrator. He/she can also do this under <strong>administration &gt; reviewing</strong> and clicking the <strong>X</strong> next to the research title. This will also open the exposition for editing again.</p>
<h3 id="reviewing-assigning-reviewers">Reviewing, assigning reviewers</h3>
<p>The most common next step is to assign reviewers to this research. However, for a person to be available as reviewer, they first have to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>have an RC account</li>
<li>added to the reviewer pool of the portal.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reviewer role does not require a full RC account, it is enough to be a limited RC user.</p>
<p>For the second requirement, the user has to be added to the reviewer pool of the portal. This can be done by going to the <strong>Portal</strong> page of the <strong><a href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/admin">admin section</a></strong> and then choosing edit. Under the ROLES tab, RC users can be added as reviewers for that particular portal.</p>
<p>Once a reviewer is part of the review pool, they can be added to the research exposition. To do this, go to <strong>review</strong> tab of the <strong>administration</strong> part of the RC, and click the edit page. Here you can add (or remove) reviewers to the research. Reviewers can be either added single blind (they cannot see each other), or double blind (they cannot see the author’s name).</p>

</figure>
<p>The reviewers will see a list of expositions that they are reviewers of on top of their “my profile” page. Within the exposition they can use the “REVIEW” menu to leave notes to themselves, which are only visible to them and the portal administrator. Typically further communication between the portal admin and the reviewer takes place through the messaging system or by e-mail.</p>
<h2 id="final-publication-or-rejection">Final publication or rejection</h2>
<p>Once the review process has been completed, the portal can choose to either publish or dismiss the exposition. If the exposition is dismissed, this means that the editing rights are returned to the author. The author can resubmit the same exposition later, at which point the review process starts again. Instead of rejecting, one can also put the exposition <a href="#in-revision" title="in revision documentation">“in revision”</a>, which means the author can make changes, while the exposition is still listed on the “reviewing” tab of administration.</p>
<p>If the exposition is accepted, the exposition will be frozen permanently from further changes. Depending on the portal settings at this point also a DOI will be deposited through cross-ref. Please note that publishing is meant as a one way step, unpublishing is to be used only as a very last resort measure. If one does not expect to have a research be published perminately, it should not be published.</p>
<p>Immediately after publication the exposition will show up on the RC frontpage and visible to any visitor to the RC website (so also non-RC users). It is recommended that keywords are added to publications, so they can more easily be retrieved. Keywords can also be added after publication, on the research list. If this is not desired, one can also choose to publish an exposition “limited to the portal”, this means only members of the portal can see the exposition.</p>

<h3 id="add-edit-a-user-dialog">Add / Edit A User Dialog</h3>
<p>Important: when you type a new user name, the RC tries to find if the user exists already. If it does, the RC will show a dialog requesting if you want to add the existing user to the portal instead of creating a new account. It is highly discouraged for a single person to have two accounts on the RC, so normally admins are expected to simply add this existing account.</p>
<h3 id="profile">Profile</h3>
<figure>
<img src="images/user-profile.png" title="image showing user profile dialog" alt="user profile dialog" /><figcaption>user profile dialog</figcaption>

<p>Change the name, alias, email and password (optional). An administrator can also change these fields without having to change the password (by leaving the field empty).</p>
<h3 id="portal">Portal</h3>
<figure>
<img src="images/user-portal.png" title="image showing user portal settings" alt="user portal settings dialog" /><figcaption>user portal settings dialog</figcaption>

<h3 id="roles">Roles</h3>
<figure>
<img src="images/user-roles.png" title="image showing user role settings" alt="user role settings dialog" /><figcaption>user role settings dialog</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When the option is turned on, the user cannot create any content. This is the default when a user has registered an account by themselves. Limited users can still become supervisors, read expositions or added as reviewers. To allow users to create expositions, works and applications, you have to turn this option OFF.</p>
<p>Before a portal admin upgrades a user to a full account, the user will have to have read and signed the “terms of use” agreement letter. This is available for download from the portal partner basecamp or directly from SAR.</p>

<h3 id="log-in-as-a-user">Log in as a user</h3>
<p>The admins can log in as another user, for example to help resolve issues with a specific account. While logged in as another user, you will see a red bar on the top of your window that shows who you are and enables you to switch back to your own account. This feature is useful while helping somebody with issues specific to their account.</p>
<p>Keep in mind: you become this user in all the tabs of your browser window, so you would temporarly loose some of you admin permissions while navigating as this user.</p>

<p>For advanced layout, you can use the HTML button. Images need to be small and embedded as URI</p>
<p>Note that for RC wide mailings, one should <u><strong>always</strong></u> use the <strong>JAR Template</strong> and type = <strong>Announcement</strong> setting. This makes the mailing include an unsubscribe link, that is required by EU law. All other combinations of settings will currently not include this link !</p>
<p>The JAR Template includes several standard fields (title, contact and a banner image), be sure to check that you are not adding duplicates in the email body text itself. One should always test before requesting it to be sent out.</p>
<p>The announcement option has to be scheduled at least 1 day in advance. The sending of the email will have to be approved by SAR.</p>

<h3 id="unpublishing-an-exposition">Unpublishing an exposition</h3>
<p>The unpublishing of expositions is not encuraged. Published expositions are supposed to be a permament reference, never to be deleted or changed. If an exposition is to be continuously changed or temporary, it is better to not publish, but simply set its sharing settings to <strong>public</strong>. When unpublishing an exposition make sure with the author of the exposition that there are no connected works that have been deleted since, otherwise it may be impossible to reconstruct the publication.</p>
<h2 id="connection-requests">Connection Requests</h2>
<p>It is possible for users to connect a work or exposition to a portal. The works that have been accepted by an admin of the portal will be listed here. Requests can be accepted with: <strong>V</strong> or rejected with: <strong>X</strong>.</p>
<p>Once research is connected, the portal admin can add an <strong>Editor</strong> role to the expositions. The editor is than able to change the content within the exposition.</p>
<p>They can also add <strong>Supervisor</strong> role, which can only read the exposition.</p>
<h2 id="reviewing-admin">Reviewing (admin)</h2>
<p>The reviewing page allows managment of expositions that have been applied for publication by the author. Reviewers or editors can be assigned to these works. When a reviewer is added they will automatically recieve a notification from RC that they have been added. Reviewers can leave notes only visible to themselves (so not to other reviewers) and the portal admin(s).</p>

<h3 id="in-revision">In revision</h3>
<p>It is possible to put an exposition “in revision”, this means the author can change the content again, but the exposition remains in the list on the reviewing page (so the admin can keep track of the progress).</p>
<p>You will be able to include a message to author, so they are informed that they can edit the exposition again.</p>
<p>During revision, reviewers will not be able to access the exposition. They will regain access when the status is changed back to “in review”. This to ensure that no reviewer is reading an exposition that is currently being edited. Reviewers’ comments (“yellow sticky notes”) will be invisible to the author; notes from the portal admin and editors will be visible to the author.</p>
<p>Either the author can resubmit the exposition using the hamburger menu, or the portal admin can change the status using the change status action button: <img src="images/revision-action.png" class="icon inline"></p>
<h3 id="publication-dialog">Publication dialog</h3>
<p>When a publication request is accepted, the portal admin can choose to which issue it belongs and if the publication should be local to the portal (limited publication) or public (the whole world). Issues can be created using the <a href="#issue-page" title="the issue page documentation">issue page</a>. You can also write a custom message to the author.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/admin/issue/list" title="issue page on the RC">Issue page</a> is an overview page within the RC that shows all published expositions that are part of an issue.</p>
<p>An Issue page consists of the title and description of the issue itself and a gridded preview of all the expositions (title, author, abstract and a thumbnail). This page is responsive so is easy to read on a phone as well.</p>
<p>Issues names are managed on this <a href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/admin/issue/list" title="issue list page">here</a>.</p>
<p>In the <strong>issue section</strong> (between “portal” and “research”) of the administration interface, the number, title and description of issues can be edited.</p>
