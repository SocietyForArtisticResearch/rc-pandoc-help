is peer reviewed, while the remaining expositions and other information
are quality controlled by the individual author(s) themselves. As a
result, the RC is highly inclusive.</p>
<p>The open access and open source spirit of the RC is essential to its
nature and serves its function as a connective and transitional layer
between academic discourse and artistic practice, thereby constituting a
discursive field for artistic research.</p>
<p>The Research Catalogue is provided by the <a
href="https://www.societyforartisticresearch.org"
title="SAR website">Society for Artistic Research (SAR)</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-i-use-the-rc-for">What can I use the RC for?</h2>
<p>Research Catalogue has been used for publishing articles, project
documentation, thesis works, peer reviewed journal publications and
course materials within the field of Artistic Research.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-rc">Why use RC ?</h2>
<!-- is this clear ? -->
<p>The RC creates a link between:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>elaborated documentation of artistic work,</li>
<li>expositions and comments that engage with the contribution of the
work as research</li>
<li>creation of individual profiles that present the researchers
work.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is believed that the reflective space provided by the RC
constitutes an essential part of the research process by providing a
suitable structure in which to develop the relationship between
documentation and presentation, whilst also retaining congruence with
art itself.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-rc-exposition">What is an RC Exposition ?</h2>
<p>In contrast to most other repositories, research data is not
presented as folders or lists of files. In the RC, authors can design a
context in which both reflective texts and the artistic results may be
presented. The balance and priority between the different media formats
(audio, video, image and text) is open to the author. Such multi-media
presentations are known as <strong>expositions</strong>. Expositions can
be edited either using a graphical drag-and-drop editor or written using
a text-based editor. Various types of import formats are also supported.
Multiple authors can collaborate in a single exposition.</p>
<h3 id="connection-between-rc-and-jar">Connection between RC and
JAR</h3>
<p>The RC forms the technical backbone of the Journal for Artistic
Research (JAR): potential JAR expositions emerge from the range of the
artistic research activities taking place in the RC. Moreover,
submissions and peer-reviewing for JAR takes place in the RC.
Expositions published in JAR are either nominated by authors, or
directly selected by JAR editorial board.</p>
<h1 id="setting-up-your-account">Setting up Your Account</h1>
<p>When you register an account in the RC, you will first just have a
basic account. This will allow you to be a supervisor, review
expositions, and leave comments. Some application calls may also accept
limited user accounts to submit forms.</p>
<p>Limited accounts do not have the option to create expositions or
publish work. Due to copyright laws, if you are interested in making
your content public in the Research Catalogue, you need to register as
author by upgrading your limited account to a full account. <span
class="red">Important: if you are a student or staff member of an
institution that has a portal within the RC, you should contact your
local portal admin for upgrading to a full account. You can find the
contact info of portal admins <a
href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/1369076/1369075">here</a>.</span></p>
<p>The account upgrade is free of charge. You can upgrade your limited
account by logging in, and clicking “request upgrade”, where you will be
instructed to send in a proof of identity to
support@researchcatalogue.net. Please read about “safe upgrade” below,

<h2
id="institutional-portals-journals-and-project-portals">Institutional
Portals, Journals and Project Portals</h2>
<p>It is possible for institutions to open their own Institutional
Portal in the Research Catalogue. Having a portal will allow
institutions to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publish research to a highly relavant audience (there are 30000
registered users in the RC, all specific to the Artistic Research
field).</li>
<li>Use the RC to manage, edit, review and publish a rich media online
journal.</li>
<li>Use RC as a teaching platform for students.</li>
<li>Organize researchers in portal subgroups, for easy collaboration of
a small group of authors.</li>
<li>Publish and share research resources interally to only the users
connected to the portal.</li>
<li>Use the RC as a closed archive.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, please contact Society for Artistic Research
(SAR).</p>

<h1 id="licenses">Licenses</h1>
<p>Authors can choose different licenses for both their expositions and
media. A license specifies under what conditions your material - or
cannot - be (re)used. All rights reserved is the most strict license: it
means that people need your permission to use any material. Choosing a
less restrictive Creative Commons license makes it easier for your
materials to be used, reproduced and distributed by others.</p>
<p>Peer-reviewed journals may have differing views on licenses, usually
based on the requirements of Open Access.</p>

<h1 id="media-repository">Media Repository</h1>
<p>The media repository allows RC users to navigate, organize and manage
their media. Each user can browse the media that is used in their
expositions (the <a
href="https://guide.researchcatalogue.net/#simple-media">simple
media</a>) or collect media files and texts with which to create an
exposition later. Beyond organizing media, you can share it with other
users of the RC. You can upload media, organize it into <a
href="#sets"><strong>sets</strong></a> and share it with other users of
the RC. It extends and replaces the older “Works” feature.</p>
<figure>
<img loading="lazy" src="images/media-repository.png" title="the media repository"
alt="Media repository" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Media repository</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="browsing">Browsing</h2>
<p>The media browser contains three tabs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Media</strong></p>
<p>The complete list of all media.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>My sets</strong></p>
<p>Your media sets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sets shared with you</strong></p>
<p>Media sets that have been shared with you by others.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are two ways of displaying the media or sets:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>gallery view</strong> displays a preview image of the
entities and helps finding media visually.</li>
<li>The <strong>list view</strong> is better suited for sorting media or
sets. Click on a column to sort a list by a certain property.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="filter-and-search">Filter and Search</h2>
<p>The filter can be used to only show certain types of media. You can
filter by <a href="#tags"><strong>tags</strong></a>, <a
href="#keywords"><strong>keywords</strong></a>, date and media type.</p>
<h2 id="creating-new-media">Creating new media</h2>
<p>There are various ways to create new media:</p>
<h2 id="upload">Upload</h2>
<p>Click “<strong>Upload media</strong>” to add a new file. Once you
have select one or more files, you will be asked to provide at least
copyright information. If you are the creator, you can fill in your own
name here.</p>
<p>Accepted types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Video (most common formats)</li>
<li>Audio</li>
<li>PDF</li>
<li>Text files: plain / html / markdown</li>
<li>Images : .png .gif .jpg .svg .tiff</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Transcoding audio and video:</strong></p>
<p>The Media Repository accepts all common audio and video formats and
will automatically convert them to web compatible format. Audio is
transcoded to 256 kbps mp3, video to mp4 with the original
resolution.</p>
<h3 id="multi-upload">Multi-upload</h3>
<p>You can select multiple files to upload at once or a folder
containing several files. You will be presented with a form block for
each file. In order to ease such a workflow you can apply the copyright
information and the set you want to add the media to from one form to
all other forms.</p>
<h3 id="text">Text</h3>
<p>Text is a media type in the media repository.</p>
<p>You can also create snippets of text by using the “<strong>create
text</strong>” button. You can select between three different types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plain text</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>Markdown</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="metadata">Metadata</h2>
<p>Every album and media entry is linked to set of metadata that include
copyright and licensing information as well as a title and the following
fields:</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>The description is not typically displayed for a reader of an
exposition but allows the author to provide additional information.</p>
<h2 id="tags">Tags</h2>
<p>Tags are meant for personal organization. Typical examples would be
“todo”, “old”, “archive”, “new”, or “in progress”. They are private to
your RC account, so no other users will see them.</p>
<p><a id="keywords"></a></p>
<h2 id="open-keywords">Open Keywords</h2>
<p>Open keywords are shared with the entire RC, any user can add any new
term to the global namespace.</p>
<p>You can either search for existing open keywords or create your own,
if the term has not been used before.</p>
<p>To prevent duplicates, the RC does not differentiate between upper
and lower case, for example: “Art” and “art” are understood to be the
same thing.</p>
<h3 id="closed-keywords">Closed Keywords</h3>
<p>Closed keywords are part of a closed and controlled vocabulary
administered and continuously extended by the RC. They are chosen so
that we can more easily interact with other repositories. They cannot be
extended by individual users.</p>
<p><a id="sets"></a></p>
<h3 id="license-picker">License picker</h3>
<p>see <a href="#licenses">licenses</a></p>
<h2 id="sets-and-sharing">Sets and Sharing</h2>
<p>Media can be organized in sets. Media can belong to multiple sets at
once. You can create a new set and by clicking “select” you can choose
the media belongs to a set.</p>
<p>Media sets can be shared with other users and in portals. Click
<strong>share</strong> to open the share form. There are three sections
in this form:</p>
<ul>
<li>The top section of this form allows you to control the visibility of
the set on your profile.</li>
<li>The middle section allows you to invite collaborates. These users
will only have read access (default) or they have write access, which
allows them to remove or change metadata and media belonging to the
set.</li>
<li>The bottom section allows you to share a set in portals. Other
members of the portal in which you share a set will see the set on your
profile even if you don’t publicly share it.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="how-to-find-expositions-and-research">How to find expositions
and research ?</h1>
<h2 id="search">Search</h2>
<p>You can search the RC by using the search field in the top right
corner. Moreover you can use the “advanced search” functionality, which
allows for filtered searches and and searches according to specific
criteria such as object type, keywords, authors, etc.</p>
<h2 id="researchers-tab">Researchers tab</h2>
<p>You can find all researchers with public content of the RC here: <a

<h2 id="follow">Follow</h2>
<p>It is possible to “follow” other users, portals, and objects such as
expositions and works. Once you are logged in you will see “follow”
links in the bottom right corner of objects displayed on the front page,
other user’s pages and other places on the RC. “Follow” links also
appear on user and portal profile pages. Once you follow a user, portal,
or object new publications, edits, comments etc. will be displayed on
the “FEEDS” page. Clicking the wrench icon opens up a dialog in which
you can adjust the precise information you want to see for each user,
portal or object you follow.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-map">Experimental map</h2>

<p><a id="my-profile-page"></a></p>
<h1 id="profile-page">Profile Page</h1>
<p>The RC profile page is both the central hub for your activities on
the RC and a public presentation of your research. You can create a
detailed public profile containing two main sections: The first has
biographical data, information on projects and events, and the second is
a list of your RC objects such as media sets and expositions.</p>
<p>Only expositions which are <a href="#share"
title="documentation on sharing">shared</a> or <a href="#publication"
title="documentation on publication">published</a> will be visible to
others. Additionally, you can hide groupings of expositions through the
small dot next to the grouping.</p>
<p>Reviewers will also see the headers “Exposition Reviewing” or
“Application Reviewing”, containing links to the expositions they have
been assigned to.</p>
<h2 id="profile-section">Profile Section</h2>
<h3 id="view-public-profile">View Public Profile</h3>
<p>You can switch between your profile’s editing mode (which includes
all your private work in progress) and your public profile, which is the
profile as other users see it. Click on “my profile” for the editing
mode and - below your profile picture - click “view public profile” to
see how other people see your profile.</p>

<h3 id="description-1">Description</h3>
<p>You can add a biography or text, that other RC users will see when
they visit your profile. Here you can also add a tagline, set your
country of residence, and list your research interests. You can also
change the email address associated with your RC account that will be
used to log in and notify you if you have turned on notifications. This
email address will not be shown to visitors of your profile. Click “edit
profile” to edit all these properties. Note that accounts that use bots
to generate advertisements that have nothing to do with research may be
hidden without notice.</p>
<h3 id="uploading-a-cv">Uploading a CV</h3>
<p>In addition to the profile description, it is possible to upload a
more extended CV as a PDF. To do so, click “upload cv” below your
profile picture.</p>

<!-- ### Degrees -->
<!-- You can also add your __degrees__ to your profile. Enter the
name, the level, the dates and the institution of your degree and link
it via the __relations-tab__ to projects, expositions or works that
you created in support for your degree. -->
<h3 id="member-of">Member of</h3>
<p>As a user you can request membership of (some of the) RC portals.
Certain actions can only be done if one is a member of the portal. For
example: for some application programs, it may be required that you are
member of the portal before you are able to submit an application for a
program.</p>
<p>In most cases however, it is the task of the portal admin to make you
a member of their portal, most portals do therefore not allow users to
request membership themselves.</p>
<p>Click edit to ask for a request to become a portal member, or remove
yourself from a portal.</p>
<h2 id="research-section">Research Section</h2>
<h3 id="create-exposition">Create Exposition</h3>
<p>By clicking “Create exposition” you can create a new exposition
object which will be opened in the RC exposition workspace editor. The
<strong>title</strong>, <strong>copyright</strong> and
<strong>abstract</strong> fields are obligatory. In most cases, the
copyright field should be the same as the main author name (so you can
write your own name). You can change these details later by choosing ☰
&gt; <strong>edit details</strong>, or in the <strong>workspace
editor</strong> by clicking the title of your research (at the top of
you screen).</p>
<p>There are three types of exposition on the RC:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#graphical-editor---workspace"
title="graphical editor documentation">Graphical/Block</a></li>
<li><a href="#text-based-editor"
title="text-based editor documentation">Text-based</a></li>
<li><a href="#html-import"
title="html import documentation">HTML-based</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>(There is also a fourth type, <strong>Research Video</strong>,
which at the moment is only available to members of the ZHDK
portal.)</em></p>
<p>For a description of the differences, please consult <a

if the exposition is still a work in progress, after (self)publication
of the research, the share status is ignored.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Self-publish</strong> turn an exposition into a fixed
object that can be safely referenced. <br/>Please note that publishing
is a one-way action, <em>once published one can not unpublish</em>. If
you want to keep the option of removing an exposition, do not use this
option. This is the only way the RC will register a DOI outside of
submitting to a journal or portal.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Add to shortcut</strong> add a compact link to this
object on the top of your profile.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Submit for review</strong> this will submit the
publication for review (and possibly publication). Submitting will
change the status of the exposition to “in review” and will prevent you

restored snapshot:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>private</strong> remove all collaborators (only you can see
the restored exposition snapshot).</li>
<li><strong>restore</strong> the collaboration will be as it was when
the snapshot was taken.</li>
<li><strong>keep</strong> the collaboration as it is in the current

</ul>
<p>One can also restore as private and change the settings afterwards of
course, through the collaboration and share menus.</p>
<h3 id="versions-of-published-expositions">Versions of published
expositions</h3>
<p>Published expositions cannot be changed in the RC (this is per
definition, to allow referencing content within these expositions by
other researchers), but duplicates can !</p>
<p>To get an editable duplicate of a published exposition one has
to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>make a snapshot of the published exposition.</li>
<li>restore the snapshot.</li>
</ol>
<p>This duplicate can now be edited, without the changes having effect
on the original published exposition.</p>
<h2 id="edit-research">Edit Research</h2>

<p><strong>Author Pseudonym</strong>: by default an exposition always
appears under the name of the user(s) that have edited it. The
<strong>author pseudonym</strong> field allows you to customize what is
displayed as author, for example if you are publishing an exposition as
a group (ie “The Beatles”, “Monty Python”) or when representing somebody
or something else. If an <strong>author pseudonym</strong> is provided,
the author pseudonym will replace the authors names wherever the work is
shown on RC (and in the <a href="https://www.doi.org">DOI</a> deposit,
if the exposition is published).</p>
<h3 id="being-anonymous">Being anonymous</h3>
<p><strong style="color:red">Important: using a pseudonym does not make
you fully anonymous</strong>, as the authors and co-authors will still
be displayed in the metadata (contributors are not shown). The only way
to be fully anonymous, is to request an ALIAS for your account as a
whole. You can request an ALIAS by contacting: <a
href="mailto:support@researchcatalogue.net">support@researchcatalogue.net</a>.
In this case, your own name will not be shown anywhere in public pages
of the RC, however even with an ALIAS, SAR will still be able to
indentify the user that created the exposition if there is copyright

<h3 id="grouping">Grouping</h3>
<p>Default groupings: When you create a set or exposition the new
objects will appear in default groupings (“Sets” and “Expositions”). If
you are invited to one by another RC user, they will appear under
“Expositions (collaborated)”.</p>
<p>Custom grouping: You can also create your own groupings. To add a new
grouping click [ add grouping ] and enter the name of the grouping. You
can sort your objects within a grouping, arrange the groupings
themselves and move object between groups via drag and drop. Click and
drag a grouping itself to change the order of the groups.</p>
<p>On the right-hand side of a grouping’s title, there are a series of
icons displayed. Here you can edit and delete the grouping and control
its public visibility (using the circle icon).</p>
<p>Only custom grouping can be deleted. If you have only one grouping
containing content, its title will not be shown on your public profile.
Empty groupings will also not be displayed on your public profile

<h1 id="exposition-editor">Exposition Editor</h1>
<p><em>workspace</em></p>
<h2 id="choosing-an-editor">Choosing an Editor</h2>
<p>The main editors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>graphical</strong> editor</li>
<li><strong>block</strong> editor</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Users can combine both <strong>graphical</strong> and
<strong>block</strong> edited pages in a single exposition.</em></p>
<p>And some specialized editors (cannot be combined):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>text-based</strong> editor</li>
<li><strong>HTML</strong> import</li>
</ul>
<p>When creating a new exposition you are asked to choose which editor
you want to start with. Graphical and block pages are part of the same
format and can be mixed, but text and HTML are separate formats. It is
therefore important to make the right choice for a particular project at
the outset.</p>
<p>Some portals will not accept HTML imported submissions, consult the
portal before you start using the HTML import.</p>
<figure>
<img loading="lazy" src="images/format-picker.png" title="format picker"
alt="choosing a format in the Create Exposition dialog" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">choosing a format in the Create
Exposition dialog</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The <a href="#workspace-editor"><strong>graphical
editor</strong></a>, allows the author to set the position of each
element in the page. This makes it easy to have non-linear formats or
presentations in which the media, such as images, video and audio files,
are as important, if not more important, as the text. The editor works
by dragging and dropping. There is no predefined style or template and
it’s possible to have the reader go through the content in a non-linear
fashion. However, a consequence of absolutely positioning all elements
is that the exposition cannot adjust to the size of a particular device,
that is, these expositions are not <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">“responsive”</a>.
If you want readers to be able to read your exposition on mobile device
the block editor or the text-based editor may be more suitable for your
project.</p>
<p>The <a href="#block-editor"><strong>block editor</strong></a>, uses
the same tools and drag-and-drop interface as the graphical editor, but
positioning is relative and the result is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">“responsive”</a>.
It can be chosen when creating a new page within an exposition. Instead
of an absolute grid, the block editor uses a row and column structure.
It is suitable for dealing with pages that have a lot of “inline”
content, where media is inserted between or beside blocks of text, or
media has to be positioned in relationship to certain elements in a
text. It is less suitable for diagrams, maps or overlayed materials.</p>
<p>The <a href="#text-based-editor"><strong>text-based
editor</strong></a> allows creating blog-like expositions through
writing and editing text. Pages using the text-based editor cannot be
combined with block or graphical editors. The editor is optimized for
writing (and importing) texts, while still supporting the embedding of
media. You can structure and format your exposition using <a
href="http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>
notation. Content can be automatically imported and exported from and to
various external formats, for example MS Word documents, Open Office
documents and LateX. Styling can be costimized extensively using <a
href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/"
title="more information on CSS">CSS</a>. Text-based expositions are
<em>responsive</em> and thus mobile friendly.</p>
<p><strong>HTML import</strong></p>
<p>For users that need more customization, there is an option to <a
href="#html-import">import static HTML</a> website as a whole. The RC
does not provide editors for HTML, so for that option an external editor
is to be used. JavaScript is not supported.</p>
<p>Finally, there is an option to import a Research Video, from the <a
href="https://www.zhdk.ch/forschungsprojekt/research-video-549545">“Research
Video” project by ZHDK</a>.</p>

<h2 id="views">Views</h2>
<p>This applies to both the graphical and block editor.</p>
<h3 id="preview">Preview</h3>
<p>The preview is the final result that the reader will see when opening
your exposition, for example through the exposition URL or when a user
clicks “OPEN EXPOSITION” anywhere on the RC. All expositions have <a
href="#navigation">a navigation bar</a> that shows if the user moves the
mouse cursor to the top. It contains a table of contents, abstract and
other information.</p>
<p>While you are editing your exposition in the workspace editor, the
Preview button (<img loading="lazy" src="images/eye_metro.svg" class="icon" />, right
top corner) shows what the page will look like to the reader. If you
already have a preview tab open, the second time you click Preview, it
will simply refresh, instead of opening a new tab.</p>
<!-- THIS SHOULD BE IN VIDEO AND AUDIO TOOLS ?
Note, that the video player, the audio player, the slideshow and object tool are only displayed fully in this PREVIEW view. 
-->
<p>Note: while for the reader the exposition will always open the
<strong>entry page</strong> of your exposition, clicking the PREVIEW
button in the editor shows the page that you currently are working on in
your workspace. Thus, you can also PREVIEW pages that are not yet listed
in the table of contents.</p>
<h3 id="workspace-view">Workspace View</h3>

</figure>
<p>The <strong>workspace editor</strong> is the editor of content on the
RC. It can be opened by clicking <strong>☰ &gt; edit workspace</strong>
on an exposition listed on your profile. If you are reading one of your
own expositions, you can also open the editor by clicking
<strong>EDIT</strong> in the navigation bar on top. Which editor will
show will depend on the format.</p>
<p>Published epositions cannot be edited (by definition) and you need to
be the author, co-author or editor of an exposition to be able to edit
an exposition.</p>
<!-- ### Note view
 
The note-view is to be used in conjunction with the note-tool of the
RC. Notes are meant to be used to communicate between author and
reviewers or supervisors and authors. The note-view displays a list of
all the notes that are within an exposition. One can filter this list
based on the author, assignee and depending on its status (resolved,
unresolved). You can also change these parameters in this view. 

### Text view

The text-view displays the text content of your exposition. You can
activate the text-view by clicking on the button on the
view-options. You have the opportunity to show or hide changes. You
can also sort the items and open the html-editor to directly edit the
content in the text-view.
 
You can close both views by clicking on "close note view" or "close
text view" in the top-right.

For more info on specific tools, see [workspace](#research-catalogue-workspace-tools). -->
<h2 id="editor-basics">Editor Basics</h2>
<p>When you open the editor you will see math-paper like area in the
center. This is called the grid. Content is added by
dragging-and-dropping “tools” from the toolbar onto the grid. You can
preview what the exposition looks like to the reader by clicking the
“preview” button: <img loading="lazy" src="images/eye_metro.svg" class="icon">This
preview button is located at the top right.</p>
<p>The position of content in graphical expositions is determined by the
author and is always absolute. This implies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tools are not positioned relative to each other, (re)moving one will
not affect the others.</li>
<li>The canvas size is unlimited: it will grow automatically when you
add tools.</li>
<li>Tools can be placed on top of each other.</li>
<li>Layout will not change depending on the screensize of the viewer
(content is not <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">“responsive”</a>
).</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above results in the graphical editor being most suitable
for non-linear layouts. For simpler expositions, it can be worthwhile to
consider using the block editor or the text based editor ( see <a
href="https://guide.researchcatalogue.net/#choosing-an-editor">choosing

</figure>
<p>The block editor is an alternative method of creating exposition
pages. It allows the author to use the same media tools as the graphical
editor, but instead of exact positions, the page is built up using
blocks.</p>
<p>Block-page content is organized using rows and columns. The main
structure is a single stack of rows. Each row can either be a single
block, or a custom division in columns.</p>
<p>An important aspect (and advantage) is that the height and vertical
position will automatically fit the content: the bottom of the previous
tool determines where the next one starts. The blocks are thus stitched
together end to end, never overlapping. This means it easier to work
with text content.</p>
<p>Using relative sizes like this is often associated with the concept
of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">responsive
web design</a>.</p>
<h3 id="when-to-use">When to use</h3>
<p>The block editor is most suitable for:</p>
<ul>
<li>exposition content that you want to be readable on all screens.</li>
<li>expositions where the content forms a block:
<ul>
<li>text with inline media</li>
<li>text with media that should be next to a certain position in the
text</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The block editor is less suited for:</p>
<ul>
<li>free-form layouts</li>
<li>diagrams</li>
<li>maps</li>
<li>timelines</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain tools (Sync, Shape) for example, can only be used in
graphical pages, although more will become available in the future.</p>
<p>The <strong>block editor</strong> provides functionality similar to
<strong>text-based editor</strong> (which is also responsive), but the
difference is that you can more easily create horizontal rows of content
and the editing is drag and drop, using the same tools as the graphic
editor. This also means that both type of page can be used in a single
exposition.</p>
<h3 id="basic-usage">Basic usage</h3>
<p>You can choose the block editor when creating a new exposition or
when creating a new page within an existing exposition.</p>
<p>A block page is organized as a list of boxes which are called
<strong>rows</strong>. A row is created by clicking the black
<strong>+</strong> at the bottom of the previous block.</p>
<figure>
<img loading="lazy" src="images/create_block.png"
title="image of how to create a block" alt="creating a new column" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">creating a new column</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can then choose a column layout for this block:</p>
<figure>
<img loading="lazy" src="images/choose_layout.png" title="picking a layout"
alt="column layout options" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">column layout options</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Within each <strong>row</strong>, you can have one or more
<strong>columns</strong> of <strong>cells</strong> dividing the content
in that row. You can think of it as a table, except that the number of
columns is allowed to be different for each row. Within a
<strong>column</strong> you can drag-and-drop any number of tools,
although it is probably a good idea not too have too many in one column,
since this will make it harder to change layout afterwards.</p>
<p>You can add tools by clicking the green “+” sign, or dragging them
from the toolbar:</p>
<figure>
<img loading="lazy" src="images/editing_cells.png" title="adding tools in block mode"
alt="editing content" />

title="example rows and columns" alt="example rows and columns" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">example rows and columns</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The default is 1 column in the row, in which you are basically just
editing a list of tools. When you create or drag and drop new tools in
the column, they will be added to bottom of that column.</p>
<p>You can change the layout, move or delete the row by using the black
controls on the right top:</p>

alt="column controls" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">column controls</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="optional-breaking-point-for-smaller-screens">Optional breaking
point for smaller screens</h3>
<p>On small screens, a high number of columns can become problematic.
For these situations, you can set a breaking point. If the screen width
is below this point, any multicolumn row will be displayed as a single
column.</p>

</figure>
<h3 id="editing">Editing</h3>
<p>You can move tools by dragging and dropping them from one cell to the
other. Dropped tools will never replace tools, they will insert at the
bottom of the current cell.</p>
<p>You can also move an entire row by dragging it from the “compass”
icon visible at the top right corner of a row.</p>
<h3 id="hyperlinks-in-the-block-editor-table-of-contents">Hyperlinks in
the block editor / Table of Contents</h3>
<p><strong>Hyperlink</strong></p>
<p>It is possible to construct a hyperlink to a specific tool within a
block page. To retrieve such a tool link, right click the tool and
choose “copy tool link”. This will copy the tool url to your clipboard,
so you can use it to create a hyperlink elsewere.</p>

entries, where you can choose a page and a tool within your page to link
to.</p>

<p>The text tool is designed for quickly adding text.</p>
<p>It has two states: when it is in <em>active state</em> you can change
the text, if you click outside of the tool, you can move the tool and
change its size. Double click inside of the tool to start editing the
text again. Content is saved as soon as you exit the text editing
state.</p>
<p>If you right-click the text tool, you can find some extra edit
options under <strong>edit</strong>. You can also (while hovering over a
text tool with your mouse) click the (☰) menu icon and choose
<strong>edit</strong>.</p>
<p>In comparison to the HTML-tool, the text tool allows you to edit your
text directly on the page. While the HTML-tool opens a new dialog
window. If you need more styling options, or want change the HTML source
code of text, use the HTML-tool. A text tool can be converted to an
HTML-tool via the menu option <strong>convert to HTML tool</strong>.</p>
<p>Regarding the availability of typefaces/fonts please read <a
href="#fonts">fonts</a>.</p>
<h4 id="placing-images-on-top-of-text-tools">Placing images on top of
text tools</h4>
<p>An important advice regarding text tools in the graphical editor is
to <strong>keep them short</strong>. As a rule of thumb, keep the height
below 1-2 screenheights maximum. Taller tools can result in positioning
errors between the text content and other tools and text in your
exposition.</p>
<p><em>The reason for this is that browsers are not identical when it
comes to text-rendering, there are actually minute differences (a
fragment of a pixel) that can add up and cause serious alignment issues
if your tools are bigger. This risk is worsened by the fact that you as
the author will not notice: because the magnitude of error is actually
dependent on what browser your reader is using.</em></p>
<p>If you find your design requires taller text-tools with illustrations
inline, use the specialized <a href="#block-editor">block editor</a>
instead, or split the text tools in smaller parts: <img
src="images/proper-use-text.png" title="the proper use of text tools"
alt="proper way of combining text with other tools" /></p>
<h4 id="scrollbars">Scrollbars</h4>
<p>If the text within a text tool is longer than the tool height, a
scrollbar will appear and part of the text is cutoff. Therefore
(especially when copying from external editors) it is important to check
that the tool has a large enough size (unless you specifically want a
scrollbar).</p>
<h4 id="style">Style</h4>
<p>See <a href="#style-options">style options</a>.</p>
<h4 id="options">Options</h4>
<p>If a text is longer than its frame on the weave, a scrollbar is
generated automatically. You can control the visibility of the scrollbar
in <strong>options</strong>. The default setting is <em>automatic</em>.
Be careful setting this to <strong>never</strong>: if a text tool is too
small to display all the text, it will be impossible for the reader to
see all the text.</p>

<p>The HTML-tool is used for advanced text editing. It is a
<em>what-you-see-is-what-you-get</em> rich text editor. Unlike the text
tool, you can only edit its content in a dialog box.</p>
<h4 id="media">Media</h4>
<figure>
<img loading="lazy" src="images/html-tool.png" title="html tool media tab"
alt="html tool media tab" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">html tool media tab</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Text is edited in the <strong>media</strong> tab. You can style your
text using the buttons.</p>
<p><em>! important: If you copy-paste your text from Word, Pages,
LibreOffice, Google Docs or any other text editor, note that not all
fonts and styles will show the same on every computer. A safer practice
is to import the text without any formatting, and format it within RC.
This can be done either by exporting your text as plain text and copy
pasting from that version, or importing your document using the <a
href="#import-word-documents-using-simple-media-upload">document
import</a></em></p>
<p>To enlarge the palette of text styling options, click on the first
button, <strong>show/hide toolbars</strong>. Opening it will allow you
to insert lists, enumerations, tables, citations. Regarding the
availability of typefaces/fonts please read <a
href="#fonts">fonts</a>.</p>
<p>Another commenly used feature is the hyperlink button (it looks like
a chain link). This can be used to insert <a
href="https://guide.researchcatalogue.net/#hyperlinking">hyperlinks</a>
or <a
href="https://guide.researchcatalogue.net/#footnotes">footnotes</a> into
your text.</p>
<p>The top right button opens the editor in fullscreen. Note: you will
have to exit full screen mode to submit your changes, using the same
button.</p>
<p><a id="html-tool-bar-extended"></a></p>
<figure>
<img loading="lazy" src="images/html-tool-bar-extended.png"
alt="html extended tool options" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">html extended tool options</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 id="anchors-graphicalblock">Anchors (Graphical/Block)</h4>
<p>You can use the anchor button to insert standard HTML anchors to a
specific location in your HTML tool. When creating a hyperlink to your
anchor, do not forget to prefix it with a ‘#’. So if you anchor is
called “anchor1”, the link should be to “#anchor1”.</p>
<h4 id="tips-using-the-html-tool">Tips using the HTML tool:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Make sure the tool size matches the length of the text within. If
the text is too long, it will result in
<strong>scrollbars</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>It is possible to insert image or even iframes within an HTML
tool, but it is not recommended in most situations. Preferably media is
added to the catalogue using the appropriate tools, to avoid the of risk
external content going missing when it is removed by the original
source. Never copy a media link from a resource in the RC, since it has
a timeout.</p></li>
<li><p>Be careful making very large texts within a single HTML tool,
this may result in unexpected overlap when your exposition is viewed
with another browser. 3 or 4 paragraphs per tool is a good average. If
you do make a large HTML tool, keep a large margin at the bottom
bordor.</p></li>
<li><p>You can also choose the colour or the background of the text
using the colour tools, insert symbols and tables, and control the edits
with the <strong>show changes</strong> option.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="style-1">Style</h4>
<p><a href="#style-options">&gt; See style options</a></p>
<h4 id="options-1">Options</h4>
<p>If a text is longer than its frame on the weave, a scrollbar is
generated automatically. You can control the visibility of the scrollbar
in <strong>options</strong>. The default setting is <em>automatic</em>.
Be careful setting this to <strong>never</strong>: if a text tool is too
small to display all the text, it will be impossible for the reader to
see all the text.</p>
<h4 id="templates">Templates</h4>
<p>If you want to reuse the content of an HTML-tool, you can create your
own templates. This function can be found in the <strong>media</strong>
tab. After finishing the edit of your template, click
<strong>save</strong> <strong>as</strong> <strong>new</strong>
<strong>template</strong> and give the template a name in the dialog box
that appears. To load a template, click <strong>load template</strong>
and choose one from the list in the dialog box.</p>
<h4 id="submit-delete-or-cancel">Submit, Delete, Or Cancel</h4>
<p>Finally, you need to exit the dialog window. If everything is the way
you want it, choose <strong>submit</strong> and the text field will be
loaded on the weave. To discard changes to the content, cancel the
dialog box. If you want to delete the whole HTML field, including all
content in it, click <strong>delete</strong>. Unintended deletions can
be restored via <strong>commands</strong> – <strong>restore deleted
tools</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="image-tool">Image Tool</h3>
<p>Also known as the <em>picture tool</em></p>
<p>To add a picture, drag and drop the <strong>image</strong> icon from
the tool palette onto the weave. As with all other tools, a pop-up
dialog appears automatically and gives you the choice between
“selecting” or “adding” an item.</p>
<p>You can upload image files in the following formats: <em>jpg, png,
tiff, gif, psd, tga, bmp.</em> For uploading PDFs, please use the
PDF-tool. At the moment, regardless of the format, the RC will convert
the image to a PNG (a lossless format). It’s dimensions will be
optimized to the specific use in the tool.</p>
<p>To add an item, choose “add” and upload the object from your desktop
to the RC servers. Name the file and make a declaration of the copyright
holder. Once an image is uploaded it is also automatically added to the
simple media tab.</p>
<h4 id="style-2">Style</h4>
<p><a href="#style-options">&gt; see style options</a></p>
<h4 id="options-2">Options</h4>
<p>There are options available to change how images are resized in
relation to the green border containing the image. This is controlled by
changing the size parameter, which can be set to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>contain</strong> : make the image small enough to fit
without changing the aspect ratio (<strong>default</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>cover</strong> : crop part of the image that is not fitting
(aspect ratio stays the same)</li>
<li><strong>fit</strong> : stretch the image (aspect ratio changes)</li>
<li><strong>auto</strong> : let the browser decide which part should be
cut off</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also change the <em>position</em> within the border ie:
top-left, right-bottom etc…</p>
<p>In <strong>settings</strong> you are able to lock the aspect ratio.
And you can allow readers to enlarge the image by activating the
checkbox “on click open image in popup.”.</p>
<p>If you want to use a picture as a hyperlink, paste a URL into the
field <em>on click open link</em>.</p>
<p>You can also set a <em>tooltip text</em> (a text that shows when the
user ‘hoovers’ his mouse over the picture) for the image. Set the
<strong>show on hoover</strong> option to <strong>plain text</strong>
and enter your text in the box below.</p>
<p>You can also make the tooltip display the copyright info, by setting
the <strong>show on hoover</strong> option to
<strong>copyright</strong>.</p>
<p>Please note, you can’t change the copyright information in the “edit
picture” window. To change the name or the copyright text, close the
current dialog and go to the item in <strong>simple media</strong> and
click <strong>edit</strong> (also double click) to open the <strong>edit
media</strong> dialog.</p>
<h3 id="audio-tool">Audio Tool</h3>
<p><a
href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/273532/1685164#tool-1687981">&gt;
Audio tool tutorial</a></p>
<p>As with the other tools, use the audio tool by dragging and dropping
the icon from the tool palette onto the weave. A pop-up dialog window
appears automatically and gives you the choice between “selecting” or
“adding” an item. Selecting is for previously uploaded media (either
through other audio tools or the media manager). Adding allows you to
upload a new file.</p>
<p>The following formats are supported: <em>ogg, wav, mov, au, mp4 audio
container formats; mp2, mp3, aac, pcm a-law, flac audio codec</em>
formats. All audio file formats will be transcoded to mp3s with
256kpbs.</p>
<figure>
<img loading="lazy" src="images/audio-tool-dialog.png" title="Audio Tool Dialog"
alt="Audio tool upload dialog" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Audio tool upload dialog</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To minimize loading times, audio files are automatically compressed.
During the transcoding process, the name will be grayed out in the media
list and a text will be shown in the preview.</p>
<p>RC encodes with a bitrate of 256 bits per second. For further
information and technical questions see <a
href="http://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/faq" title="FAQ">FAQ
2.6</a> or contact the RC User Support.</p>
<h4 id="style-3">Style</h4>
<p><a href="#style-options">&gt; see style options</a></p>
<h4 id="options-3">Options</h4>
<p>The audio player has a number of settings:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>loop</strong> Will loop the playback when it reaches the
end of the file.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>autoplay</strong> The player starts to play back the file
as soon as the page has been loaded.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>stop other players</strong> If you are using multiple
audio (or video) players on the same weave and your page is quite big,
visitors may find it helpful if you prevent overlapping by defining
which player is playing. With this option selected, all players (video
player, audio player on slideshows, other audio players) will stop when
the selected player is playing back a file. When simultaneous playback
is desired, it may be helpful to use the <a href="#play-tool"
title="jump to play tool help">Play-tool</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>display minimal</strong> When selected, the player
consists of only the play button and bar. You can also define some
visual player settings. You can hide the whole menu bar or you can set
the visibility of the volume or define if you want a player with as few
options as possible.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As in the picture tool, if it is necessary to give textual
information about the sound file, you can enter the text to be displayed
when the mouse cursor hovers over the item.</p>
<h3 id="video-tool">Video Tool</h3>
<p><a
href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/273532/1685164#tool-1686872">Video
tutorial</a></p>
<p>As with the other tools, you can use the video tool by dragging it
from the tool bar and dropping it onto the weave or block.</p>
<p>In the dialog box that appears you have the possibility to add
(i.e. upload) items from your computer or select items from the “simple
media” or media sets.</p>
<p>If you choose “add media”, you will see the dialog below. This dialog
contains both a <strong>preview</strong> and <strong>video</strong>
field. The <strong>preview</strong> field, which controls the image that
is shown before playback, is optional: if you only provide a
<strong>video</strong>, the preview image will be generated from the
first frame. You can later also select different images to function as a
preview image. In that case, these images have to be part of your
<strong>simple media</strong> or <strong>media sets</strong>.</p>
<figure>
<img loading="lazy" src="images/add_video_file.png" title="upload video dialog"
alt="Dialog for adding a new file" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Dialog for adding a new file</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At the moment, the RC supports the following formats: <em>avi, mov,
mp4, mpg</em> video container formats; <em>dv1394, h.264, mpeg2, mpeg1,
mjepeg</em> video codec formats. Both VBR and CBR are supported.</p>
<p>The video tool currently supports resolutions up to 2048x1080. If the
resolution is higher, transcoding will fail. Please keep this in mind
while uploading videos shot on phones, which commonly provide up to 4k
resolution.</p>
<p>All media will be compressed to a smaller size, this is called
‘transcoding’. This process takes time. During the ‘transcoding’ the
file name is greyed out in your simple media. If you want, the RC can
also sent you an email when transcoding has finished. You can find that
option under <a
href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/settings"><strong>profile,
settings</strong></a>.</p>
<p>For further information and technical questions see <a
href="http://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/faq" title="FAQ">FAQ</a>
or contact the RC User Support.</p>
<p>We highly recommend using smaller video files, for easier upload. If
your file is extremely large, you may want to compress it before
uploading using a program like Handbrake, FFMpeg or QuickTime (Mac).</p>
<h4 id="style-4">Style</h4>
<p><a href="#style-options">&gt; see style options</a></p>
<h4 id="options-4">Options</h4>
<p>The video player has a number of options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>loop</strong> Loops the video when it reaches the
end.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>autoplay</strong> The player starts to playback the file
when the page is loaded.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>stop other players</strong> If you are using multiple
video players on the same weave and your page is quite big, visitors may
find it helpful if you prevent overlapping by defining which player is
playing. With this option selected, all players (video player, audio
player on slideshows, other audio players) will stop when the selected
player is running a file. When simultaneous playback is desired, it may
be helpful to use the <a href="#play-tool"
title="jump to play tool help">Play-tool</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>display minimal</strong> When selected, the player
constists of only the play button and the bar.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As in the picture tool, if it is necessary to provide textual
information on the video file you can choose to display plain text or
copyright information that will appear when the mouse cursor hovers over
the item.</p>
<p>You can also use the play tool to synchronize selected video and
audio tools.</p>
<h3 id="slideshow-tool">Slideshow Tool</h3>
<p>The slideshow tool allows you to create a gallery of images that can
be displayed in a loop. You can choose to start the slideshow
automatically and you can add an audio file to each picture of the
slideshow.</p>
<p>Drag and drop the slideshow icon onto the weave and the dialog window
will appear.</p>
<p>Open the <strong>slides</strong> tab to select the images. You can
either upload an image from your disk, by clicking <strong>add
media</strong>, or you can select images from your <strong>media
repository</strong> sets and <strong>simple media</strong> clicking
<strong>select media</strong>.</p>
<p>Each image can also be joined with an audio recording, which will be
played in the background. Only audio files that have been previously
uploaded to your <strong>simple media</strong> or <strong>media
repository</strong> can be selected to be used as background. You can
upload new audio files in your media list.</p>
<h4 id="style-5">Style</h4>
<p><a href="#style-options">&gt; see style options</a></p>
<h4 id="options-5">Options</h4>
<p>In “options” you can define the position of the image within the
frame. This is important when you are using images with different sizes
and proportions. In <strong>settings</strong> it is possible to choose
to loop the slideshow. If the <strong>loop</strong> option is enable,
the slideshow will continue with the first slide once it reaches its
last slide. You can choose to hide the navigation bar or give the reader
the option to enlarge the picture with a click on the picture in your
weave.</p>
<p>In <strong>automate</strong> you can set the autoplay options to:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>run after click</em> : run automatically after the first
click</li>
<li><em>autoplay</em> : after loading the page</li>
</ul>
<p>When choosing <em>autoplay</em> you need to define the speed with
which the slide will change. You can customise the duration of each
slide (<em>speed per slide</em>) or let each slide change at the default
speed.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, you can append audio files to each slide. Please
note, you first have to upload the file into your <strong>simple
media</strong> folder. In <strong>options</strong>,
<strong>audio</strong> you can control the time of a crossfade (when one
audio file fades out while a second fades in at a specified time). You
can also choose the fade duration and the timeout of an audio file.</p>
<h3 id="pdf-tool">PDF Tool</h3>
<p>The PDF tool gives you the possibility to add PDF documents
containing texts, graphics or scores. By default the PDF is displayed as
a small thumbnail showing a miniture of the first page. The reader of
your exposition can load this PDF in a new tab by clicking the
thumbnail. Alternatively, you can set the tool to display the PDF
content directly embedded in the page (see <a
href="#pdf-options%20%22link%20to%20pdf%20options%22">options</a>).</p>
<p>PDF is a suitable format for uploading (paper) based documents into
your exposition. The limitation is that PDF files, by nature, only
support static (printable) graphics and text, not video or audio.
Although Abobe has started to support rich media embedding in their own
PDF viewers, there is almost no support for this in other PDF viewers
(like the one in browsers). In case text from a word processor needs to
be combined with video and audio, use the <a href="#HTML-tool"
title="link to html tool">HTML tool</a> for the text and add the media
separately using the other tools.</p>
<h4 id="uploading-a-pdf">Uploading a pdf</h4>
<p>After dragging the icon to the weave, a dialog will show.<br />
Click the button <strong>ADD MEDIA</strong> to open the dialog for
uploading a PDF.<br />
Be sure to upload the PDF itself in the <strong>PDF</strong> field, not
<strong>PREVIEW</strong>. One is also requested to add copyright
information. When done, click submit and the file will begin
uploading.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The pdf tool dialog</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The <strong>PREVIEW</strong> field is for changing the image that
represents the pdf in the exposition for the reader. If no preview image
is provided, a miniturised copy of the first page will be used. You can
later change the preview image, by selecting one from your media
list.</p>
<h4 id="changing-the-pdf-preview-image">Changing the PDF preview
image</h4>
<p>If you have an existing PDF tool, you can update the preview image
with any image from your <a href="#media-list">media list</a>. If you
want to use a completely new image, you will have to add it to your <a
href="#media-list">media list</a> first.</p>
<ul>
<li>Double click the tool</li>
<li>Click the “change preview image” button</li>
<li>Select the image from the dropdown list</li>
<li>Submit</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="a-few-notes">A few notes</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Never re-use the url</strong> of the pdf file that opens
when you click the pdf tool in the preview. For example:
“https://media.researchcatalogue.net/rc/master/73723.pdf?t=2629205589&amp;e=1510816850”
These (timed) links are automatically generated by the PDF tool
specifically for the user that views the tool and are automatically
invalidated after use.</p></li>

<h4 id="options-6">Options</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Position</strong></p>
<p>The <em>position</em> options (<em>size</em>, <em>position</em>) are
only there for legacy reasons. Likely to be removed in future versions

<li><p><strong>Settings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Display in Browser</strong></p>
<p>Option to “embed” the pdf: display its content directly in the page
using the browsers built in PDF viewer. If the PDF is bigger than the
box, scrollbars will appear.</p>
<p><em>Display in Browser</em> works best if:</p>
<ul>
<li>your exposition page only contains a single PDF file and not much
else.</li>
<li>your pdf is only 1 or 2 pages long and the tool is made large enough
to fit the whole document. Always check with the
<strong>preview</strong> how the PDF looks embedded.</li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend against putting other tools on top of a <strong>“display
in browser”</strong> PDF tool, since browsers have slightly different
margins on their PDF viewers : this may result in disalignment of
content.</p>

<p>As in the picture tool, you can set a text that the reader sees when
they hoover the object. To do this, select one of the options in the
“show on hover” pull-down menu. You can create a plain text to be
displayed when the reader’s mouse hovers over the PDF preview. To use
this, choose “plain text” or “copyright &amp; plain text” from the
pull-down menu and write your text in the text field below.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sync-tool">Sync Tool</h3>
<p><em>this was previously sometimes referred to as the “play
tool”</em></p>
<p>The Sync Tool is designed to synchronize the playback of selected
video and audio tools on the same page. You connect one or more tools to
the sync tool, and the tool itself is a button that allows the reader to
start and stop playback of all connected tools at once, with one click.
This can, for example, be used to document video installations with
multiple screens and allows playing back synchronized combinations of
musical voices and audio tracks.</p>
<h4 id="media-1">Media</h4>
<p>The Sync Tool itself functions as the start/stop button, but you have
to upload your own icons or images in the tool’s Media tab to make it
visible. One is for the “play” state, starting the playback. The other
image represents stopping the playback (in all connected tools).</p>
<h4 id="options-7">Options</h4>
<p>In the options tab you can sellect which tools need to be connected
to this Sync Tool. Only tools already present in the current weave may
be selected. The option “pause other players when playing” will ensure
that only the selected media files will be played back.</p>
<h3 id="shape-tool">Shape Tool</h3>
<p>(Not available in the block editor)</p>
<p>The Shape tool is designed for placing simple graphic elements such
as arrows and lines in your exposition. You can generate forms to
structure your layout or to help navigation. You can create rectangles,
circles and lines. You can choose if they’re filled or not. You also
have the possibility to specify the thickness of the frame and control
the opacity of the elements. There are also four types of arrows (left,
right, up, down). You can resize the elements on the weave by resizing
the green frame displayed around the shape. By clicking and dragging the
yellow point you can rotate an element.</p>
<h3 id="note-tool">Note Tool</h3>
<p>(Not available in the block editor)</p>
<p>The note tool allows you to organize your work on RC, comment on
sections, and communicate with co-authors. Drag the note icon from the
tool-pallett onto the weave. You can write directly into the note
without opening a new edit-window. Each note has a time-stamp which is
generated when the note is placed on the weave.</p>
<p>It is possible to define who is responsible for the content (a change
or revision, correction) of the note and you can set a date for
resolving the issue described in the note.</p>
<p>Notes are visible on the preview as well. Please check, that all
notes have been removed from the exposition when you intend to share or
publish it.</p>
<h4 id="notes-and-user-roles">Notes and User Roles</h4>
<p>If an exposition is submitted to a portal the notes created by the
different users involved (authors, portal admins, editor, reviewers)
have different visibilities. Notes left by the author are visible to the
admin and to the editor. Notes left by the reviewer are visible to the
admin (though not the author or editor) and notes left to the editor are
visible to the author and admin (though not to the review).</p>
<h4 id="text-style-options">Text Style Options</h4>
<p>You can use the buttons to directly add the basic stylings, eg.
highlight it with bold or italic font or structure it with numerations
or lists. You can change the font-family and increase or decrease the
indentation. You can also insert links.</p>
<h4 id="history-1">History</h4>
<p>“History” provides a log of all changes that have been made to the
tool. If you have unintentionally deleted a tool, you can restore it
using “restore deleted tools” in the commands.</p>
<h3 id="embed-tool">Embed tool</h3>
<p>(Not available in the block editor)</p>
<p>The embed tool allows the integration of external content, such as
videos or sounds, into RC expositions. Currently, the RC supports the
following external content providers: <a
href="https://www.zhdk.ch/madek">Madek</a>, Youtube, Vimeo, Soundcloud
and Sketchfab.</p>
<p>The embed tool can be used by pasting the link from the page you want
to embed in the URL field and clicking submit twice. The first submit
initiates the processing of the link. How to retrieve the correct
embedding link depends on the service. The main URL visible when opening
the media content that is to be embedded can be used by the RC for the
above mentioned services. Please contact <a
href="mailto:support@researchcatalogue.net">support</a> if you have
trouble or questions regarding the necessary URL.</p>
<p>Content from Youtube and Soundcloud can be used in the play tool and
the playback can be synchronized with native RC tools.</p>
<p>Content from Madek needs to have been made publicly visible before
embedding is possible. Please copy the sharing link from Madek into the
URL field of the embed tool.</p>
<p>Important: Some RC-based journals/portals do not allow the use of
externally hosted materials. If you are making an exposition to be
published in such a portal, please check their policy first.</p>
<!-- ## Object Viewer

The object viewer tool is a designed for displaying three-dimensional
images. Is is based on the
[3DNP library](http://thoro.de/page/3dnp-introduction-en "3dnp").  By
dragging the object with the mouse cursor it can rotated around two
axis, i.e. the object can be turned around its centre and tilted back
and forth.  It is necessary to upload a series of images as a zip
file. These images need to be numbered (i.e. image001.jpg,
image002.jpg etc). Each image must the object from a different
angle. You can imagine the creation of the images as the following
process: the object rotates around a vertical axis in a number of
steps, then moving slightly around a horizontal axis and rotating
around the vertical axis in a number of steps again. This is repeated
until an image of every combination of vertical and horizontal
positions has been created. The number of different angles (steps of
rotation around the horizontal axis) is defined by the setting
"levels" in the dialog window. The number of steps of the rotation
around the vertical axis is implicitly defined by "levels" and the
total number of images. -->
<h4 id="style-options">Style Options</h4>

<p>The style tab allows you to set the way a tool looks on the outside.
There are two ways of reaching the style tab:</p>
<ul>
<li>hoovering with your mouse over the tool</li>
<li>click ☰ -&gt; <strong>edit</strong>.</li>
<li>open <strong>style</strong> tab in the dialog.</li>
</ul>
<p>For all tools except the simple text tool, one can also open
style:</p>
<ul>
<li>by double clicking on a tool in the editor</li>
<li>click <strong>style</strong> in the tabbar</li>
</ul>
<p>Click on the small “&gt;” to open one of these sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>position</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>left &amp; top</strong> : set the position of the tool in
pixels.</li>
<li><strong>width &amp; height</strong> : set the dimensions of the tool
in pixels. Image, pdf, video, audio tools will keep their aspect ratio
fixed.</li>
<li><strong>rotation</strong> : set the overal rotation of the tool. You
can also change the rotation in the editor directly by dragging it by
its yellow dot.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>padding</strong> : this adds spacing inside of the border
box defined by width and height. This means adding padding will not
increase the size of the tool.</li>
<li><strong>border</strong> : make the border defined by width and
height visible.
<ul>
<li><em>style</em> : choose a certain visual style of the border (solid,
dashed, dotted etc..)</li>
<li><em>strength</em> : set the width of the border in pixels</li>
<li><em>color</em> : set the color</li>
<li><em>radius</em> : this creates rounded corners, with a radius
defined in pixels <a id="style-shadow"></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>shadow</strong> : this creates a shadow behind the box
defined by <strong>width</strong> &amp; <strong>height</strong>. This
can be used to create the illusion of depth.
<ul>
<li><strong>margin-left &amp; margin-right</strong> : this will set the
size off the solid part of the shadow.</li>
<li><strong>unschaerfe</strong> : this will set how wide the fuzzy part
of the shadow is. You can also use this when margins are 0, resulting in
a completely fuzzy shadow around the object.</li>
<li><strong>color</strong> : set the color of the shadow.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>opacity</strong> : smaller values will make the tool more
transparent.</li>
</ul>
<p>The style tab only sets the external style of the tool, text markup
is done within the text or html tools.</p>
<h4 id="change-tool-defaults">Change tool defaults</h4>
<p>It is possible to change the default styling settings for any tool,
by double clicking the tool in the toolbar. After the default is
changed, every newly created tool will initially use these new
settings.</p>
<h4 id="history-2">History</h4>
<p>The <em>history tab</em> gives you the posibility to change the
content <strong>within the tool</strong> to an older version. The
versions of a text object are created each time you have clicked outside
it (and the three animated dots show inside). With the html tool, a
version is created each time you click submit.</p>

<h2 id="fonts">Fonts</h2>
<p>The research catalogue currently provides the following fonts:</p>
<p><strong>Sans-serif:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Anton (similar to <strong>Impact</strong>)</li>
<li>Nimbus Sans L (similar to <strong>Helvetica</strong>)</li>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">fonts overview</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you have an older exposition (created before April, 2022), you
will also be able to select additional fonts. The reason for this is
that Research Catalogue used to allow users to select these in the past.
A majority of these fonts were only available in Windows and/or MacOS.
The licensing around these proprietory fonts prevented Research
Catalogue from self-hosting them. When a font was not available locally,
the browser would switch to an alternative and this resulted in smaller
or bigger visual differences and a warning message to the user.</p>
<p>The current solution to this problem is that Research Catalogue now
provides a set of fonts that we can host ourselves. This guarentees that
a font chosen in the text &amp; html tools can never be missing. To ease
the switch, we have included replacements that are designed to closely
match the common fonts like Arial, Calibri and Helvetica and Impact.
Older expositions will keep their current fonts but allow you to also
use the new ones. Published expositions expositions cannot be changed,
but you can create a new version of the exposition.</p>
<h2 id="migration-of-fonts-in-your-expositions">Migration of fonts in
your expositions</h2>
<p>In existing expositions (that have not been published), you can
replace all current fonts to using the RC-safe set. One way would be to
do this by hand, but for convenience we also provide an automatic
option.</p>
<p>If you have a simple exposition, it is recommended to first do some
small test switching the font in a selection of tools within your
exposition by hand. If you like the result, you can then use the
migration option, which can be found in the menu: <strong>Options &gt;
Edit metadata &gt; compatibility</strong>. Due to technical limitations,
this option is not available if the exposition is “in revision” or “in
review”. If you want to apply the font migration to an exposition in
such state, please follow the instructions <strong>“Safely trying a
migration”</strong> below.</p>
<p>The font compatibility dialog will automatically detect which fonts
are used in your exposition. You will then be asked to select a
replacement font for each one.</p>
<h3 id="safely-trying-a-migration">Safely trying a migration:</h3>
<p>If you have a very complex exposition with many tools, we highly
recommend to first try the font migration on a copy instead of the
original exposition (!). You can make a copy by:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>go to your profile page</li>
<li>click the ☰ -&gt; “manage versions” option on the exposition</li>
<li>create a snapshot</li>
<li>restore the snapshot, this will appear as a separate exposition on
your profile.</li>
<li>open ☰ -&gt; edit workspace, and go to <strong>options &gt; Edit
metadata &gt; compatibility</strong> to apply the migration.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do not like the result, you can just delete the exposition and
start at step 1.</p>
<h2 id="content-manager-editor-tab">Content Manager / Editor Tab</h2>
<p>The content manager is a collection of tabs located on the right side
of the graphical &amp; block editors. It is not present in the
text-based editor.</p>

</ul>
<p><a id="media-management"></a></p>
<p><a id="overview"></a></p>
<h2 id="map">Map</h2>
<p>You can use the overview to see all objects in the exposition as both
a miniature map and a list. This can also be useful to retrieve lost
objects, or change the ordering (front to back). If you click on a tool
in the list, the editor will automatically jump to its location, you can
also double click a tool to edit the content of that tool.</p>
<h2 id="media-tab">Media tab</h2>
<p>Media files can be found, uploaded, previewed and deleted in the
“Media”-tab on the right hand side. There are subtabs: <strong>Simple
Media</strong>, <strong>Sets</strong> and <strong>“+”</strong>, which
allows the integration of external repositories, such as the Media
Archive of the Arts of the ZHdK (Madek).</p>
<h3 id="simple-media">Simple Media</h3>
<p>The simple media, which can be found within the “Media”-tab on right
hand side of the editor. Images, videos, audio and other media that have
been added in tools onto the canvas will automatically show up in simple
media tab. You can click and drag files from the simple media tab onto
your canvas in order to create tools.</p>
<p>You can also upload media here to use it as a background or preview
image in tools like the video tool and the pdf tool.</p>
<p>The list of media files can be sorted by type, name, creation date
and size and you can search for a file name by using the search
field.</p>
<p>Files that are listed in gray are in the process of being
transcoded.</p>
<p>There four buttons on top of the list of files, from left to
right:</p>
<p>[Simple media tab](images/media_manage.png ” the simple media
tab”)</p>
<ul>
<li>Upload a file</li>
<li>Preview a file</li>
<li>Edit meta-data of the file</li>
<li>Permanently delete a file from the RC (use with care)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each media file can be provided with a license, see <a
href="#licenses">licenses</a>. The licenses of all used media in an
exposition are shown on the META page.</p>
<h3 id="sets">Sets</h3>
<p>You can view the media sets you created in the Media Repository. You
have to click on the set to open and view the media. Once opened, you
can drag media onto your page. An icon will indicate if the set is
shared to you by others.</p>
<h4 id="works">Works</h4>
<p>“Works” are an older feature similar to media sets, if you had
created works in the past you will find them under sets as well.</p>
<h2 id="import-word-documents-using-simple-media-upload">Import Word
documents using Simple Media upload</h2>
<p>It is possible to upload Microsoft Word (.docx), Libre Office, Open
Office (.odt) and LaTeX documents and have the content automatically
turned into RC HTML tools and image tools.</p>
<p>To convert a document, open the Simple Media Tab and upload it in the
“document” section of the upload dialog. It may take a few moments to
convert after the upload has reached 100%.</p>
<figure>
<img loading="lazy" src="images/media-upload-tab.png" title="the media upload button"

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">upload doc dialog</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once converted, the document will show up as a folder within your
simple media. You can drag the elements from this folder to a desired
location in the exposition, resize and further adjust them. The document
will be split whevever there is an image and the images will become
available as image tools.</p>
<p>To ensure maximum compatibility with RC fonts and styling,
text-editor specific styling is automatically filtered, but the inner
structure of the text is maintained. This includes: paragraphs, headers,
bold, italics, footnotes, illustrations &amp; tables. Footnotes are also
converted into RC Footnotes/Popovers.</p>
<p>If you want to reproduce the feel of a text document in your RC
exposition, it is best to use the block editor. When importing word
content in the graphical editor, please be careful with long text tools
(which may cause issues).</p>
<h3 id="important-note-regarding-styling">Important note regarding
styling:</h3>
<p>By default, RC has zero margin on all paragraphs, this will mean that
there is no whitespace between paragraphs. To avoid this issue, I
recommend adding the following style to your <a
href="#page-settings---style" title="link to page settings docs">raw
CSS</a> settings of your page where you import word content. You can
edit the “raw css” of a page by opening <strong>pages tab</strong> &gt;
✎ <strong>edit settings</strong> &gt; <strong>style</strong> &gt;
<strong>raw css</strong>.</p>
<pre>
#container-weave .html-text-editor-content p {
    margin: 1em 0; /* set top and bottom margin to 1 */ }

#container-editor .html-text-editor-content p {
    margin: 1em 0; /* do the same for the editor */ } </pre>
<p>This makes sure paragraph margins are displayed correctly.</p>
<h2 id="pages">Pages</h2>
<p>Pages are managed in the <strong>pages</strong> tab of the content
manager. An RC exposition can consist of one or more pages. A new
exposition starts with a single page, called “default page”.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-page">Creating a page</h3>
<p>New pages are by default <em>private</em>, they have to be
explicitely added to the <a href="#table-of-content"
title="table of content">table of content</a> to be visible (or by
making a <a href="#hyperlinking">hyperlink</a> to the page in your own
content). The order of pages cannot be changed in the pages list, but
this can be done in the table of contents. The exposition page will
automatically change size based on the content.</p>
<h3 id="entry-page">Entry page</h3>
<p>One can change the first page visible to the reader by changing the
<strong>entry page</strong>. Go to the menu <strong>options</strong> and
choose <strong>edit meta data</strong>. Scroll down to <strong>“entry

want as your start page for the reader. <!--
This should be in table of contents, it is completely out of place in

<h2 id="page-settings">Page settings</h2>
<p>[the page settings dialog](images/pages-tab-2018.png ” the page

button in the bar.</p>
<h3 id="page-settings---meta-title-description-and-iframe-field">Page

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Page title</strong> Set a title for the page. This title
can be overridden in the <a href="#table-of-content">table of

you need to keep track of different versions of pages.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Description</strong> The description is for personal
reference and only visible to the author and collaborators on the
exposition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Iframe field</strong> Replace the entire page by an
external website by means of a URL. There are a few requirements to the
URL for this to work:</p>
<ul>
<li>For reasons of security, the website needs to be configured to use a
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS%20%22https%20on%20wikipedia%22">TLS
connection</a>. Links with TLS enabled can in most cases be identified
by the <strong>https://</strong> instead of <strong>http://</strong> at
the start.</li>
<li>You need to provide the full URL (inlude the https:// at the
start).</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that if a correct iFrame url is provided, the entire
weave within the exposition is replaced by that website, so any tools
and page styling present in the workspace will no longer be visible to
the reader.</p>
<p>If you want to combine external content with tools you should use the
<a href="#embed-tool">embed tool</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="page-settings---style">Page settings - Style</h3>
<p>Here one can change:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>margin</strong>: If set, it will make the exposition as if
seen through a smaller window.</li>
<li><strong>padding</strong>: Pad extra space on the content itself (for
example if you set top and left to 100, it will create extra space on
the top and left). In other words, this makes the exposition canvas
itself larger.</li>
<li><strong>background</strong>: Change the color or set an image as
background.</li>
<li><strong>links</strong>: Change the default color for all hyperlinks
within the page. One can set seperate colors for links the user
visited.</li>
<li><strong>footnote</strong>: The color of footnote/popover links works
the same way as with links, but for links of footnotes/popovers.</li>
<li><strong>raw css</strong>: apply your own CSS rules to the page, see
below</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="raw-css">raw CSS</h2>
<p>You can set user defined <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/"
title="css tutorial">CSS</a> rules that are applied to the whole page.
Cascading Style Sheets are the standard way of styling HTML documents.
Although most styling can be directly edited through the style tab, it
can sometimes be useful to specify your own CSS.</p>
<p>The CSS class for HTML tools is:</p>
<pre><code>.html-text-editor-content {
/* put your styles here */
}</code></pre>
<p>To style text within a simple text tool you have to use:</p>
<pre><code>.tool-simpletext .tool-content * {
/* put your style here */   
}</code></pre>
<h3 id="supplying-your-own-fonts">Supplying your own fonts</h3>
<p>You can include your own external fonts through CSS <span
class="citation" data-cites="import">@import</span> statements. Be aware
that many (also fonts like “Arial”), cannot be self-hosted unless you
have a license that allows that. Google Fonts has an overview of fonts
that you can freely use. Here is an example of using the “Roboto”
font:</p>
<pre><code>@import url(&#39;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:ital@1&amp;display=swap&#39;);

.html-text-editor-content * {
    font-family: roboto;
}

.tool-simpletext .tool-content * {
    font-family: roboto;
}</code></pre>
<h3 id="line-height">Line-height</h3>
<p>There is no way to control line height within the HTML or text tool,
but you can change it using CSS:</p>
<pre><code>.html-text-editor-content * {
    line-height: 2em;
}

.tool-simpletext .tool-content * {
    line-height: 2em;
}</code></pre>
<p>“em” is a relative size unit, it measures the line-height ratio from
the size of the ‘m’ character in the font.</p>
<p>Be aware that changing the CSS</p>
<h3 id="deleting-a-page">Deleting a page</h3>
<p>The page can be deleted by clicking the trashcan icon next to the
page title. Deleted pages cannot be recovered. Of course, if you want to
make a page invisible to the reader it may be prefered to just remove it
from the <a href="#table-of-content" title="table of content">table of
content</a>.</p>
<p><a id="footnotes-and-popovers"></a> <a id="footnotes"></a></p>
<h2 id="popovers">Popovers</h2>
<p><strong>Popovers</strong> are footnotes that pop up. They provide a
way to present additional content in your <em>graphical</em> and
<em>block</em> pages without cluttering the page. The popover appears
when the reader clicks/hoovers over the popovers’ activation hyperlink.
Instead of as hyperlink within text, you can also make them show up on
hoovering a particular image tool.</p>
<figure>
<img loading="lazy" src="images/popover.gif"
title="reader hoovers over a link, a popover window appears"
alt="what a popover looks like" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">what a popover looks like</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The content of a popup is edited in the same way as graphical
pages.</p>
<p><strong>Naming</strong>: Inside of the RC, <strong>Popovers</strong>
may still be refered to as <strong>Footnotes</strong> in certain places:
there is no difference in functionality.</p>
<p>A common use for <strong>Popovers</strong> was to make
bibliographical references that pop up in the text. however, the RC also
has a dedicated <a href="#references"><strong>reference
feature</strong></a> for that now, that will also generate a
bibliographical list on the metadata page.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-popover">Creating a popover</h3>
<p>Popovers can be created in two ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>As a hyperlink within text tools</li>
<li>Linked to an image tool</li>
</ol>
<p>To create a popover within a text tool, open a <strong>Text</strong>
or <strong>HTML tool</strong> and select a piece of text. After this,
click the hyperlink button <img
src="images/hyperlink-button.png" class="wide-icon" alt="insert
hyperlink"></img>, this will open a dialog:</p>
<figure>
<img loading="lazy" src="images/footnote_dia.png" title="footnote dialog"
alt="image of insert link/footnote dialog" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">image of insert link/footnote

</figure>
<p>Now choose the second tab <strong>“footnote”</strong> to create a new
<strong>popover</strong>.</p>
<p>To link a <strong>popover</strong> to an image tool, right click the
image tool and select <strong>“add footnote”</strong>.</p>

<p>You can customize the popover by setting the following
properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>The title of the popover.</li>
<li>Whether the popover will be shown when the link is clicked or on
mouseover (“View on”).</li>
<li>Where the popover will be displayed with reference to the link or
the screen in case of the last option (“screen center”).</li>
<li>Whether the background (i.e. the rest of the exposition) will be
darkened when the popover is being shown.</li>
<li>The type of the popover. This can be:
<ul>
<li>A new popover.</li>
<li>The copy of an existing popover.</li>
<li>A simple text popover. A small text box appears which facilitates
the creation of popovers containing only a short amount of text. The
text can be entered here directly upon creation without the need to
further edit the popover and adjust its size. <img
src="images/footnote_dia.png"
alt="Popover/footnote dialog window" /></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="editing-a-popover-footnote">Editing a Popover (footnote)</h3>
<p>All popovers are listed in the “Popups” tab on the right hand side.
If you click one, the RC will automatically scroll to it’s reference in
the text or image tool.</p>
<figure>
<img loading="lazy" src="images/footnotes_list_new.png" alt="List of popovers" />

<p>Within the popover editor, you can resize it by dragging its

<p><strong>“simple text”</strong> popovers are in fact automatically
generated normal popovers with your text inserted in a text tool. This
has consequences if you want to adjust the size of a <strong>“simple
text”</strong> popover as a whole, since you would also need to change
the size of the tool within that popover after resizing. To edit a
“simple text” popover internal tools, simply double click it in the
popover list.</p>
<h3
id="changing-the-position-or-display-settings-of-a-footnote">Changing
the position or display settings of a footnote</h3>
<p>If you need to change the screen position or display settings of an
existing footnote, the best way is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to the Footnote tab.</li>
<li>Click the footnote you want to change.</li>
<li>Click Edit Settings (“pen”) icon.</li>
<li>Go to the options tab.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="auto-numbered-footnotes">Auto-Numbered Footnotes</h3>
<p>Instead of using text as footnote links it is also possible to use
numbered links. The numbers will be filled in and adjusted
automatically. In order to create auto-numbered footnotes create a
footnote in the text or HTML tool as described above but without
selecting any text. An “x” will be inserted where the cursor is placed.
This “x” will be replaced by the correct number when the text is
displayed.</p>
<figure>
<img loading="lazy" src="images/footnote_auto.png"
alt="Auto-numbered footnote in the editor" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Auto-numbered footnote in the
editor</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The numbering starts at 1 and encompasses all text and HTML objects
on the weave. Numbering is performed by object and proceeds from the top
and left to the bottom and right of the page.</p>
<p>Be aware that automatic numbering does not depend on creation order,
it only depends on x and y position of the tools. This means that if the
notes (1,2,3 etc..) are in a vertical column, for example:</p>
<figure>
<img class="portrait-image" src="images/footnotes_align_correct.png" title="image demonstrating incorrect allignment will result in incorrect numbering" alt="">
<figcaption>
Footnote numbering in correctly vertically-aligned tools
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When the tools are lined up like this, footnotes are correctly
numbered. However, if one of the text tools containing an automatic
footnote in a column is just a bit (even 1 pixel) to the left, like so
(exaggeration):</p>
<figure>
<img class="portrait-image" src="images/footnotes_alignment.png" title="image demonstrating incorrect allignment will result in incorrect numbering" alt="">
<figcaption>
Incorrect auto-numbering in non-aligned tools
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Then RC will automatically number the notes in 2 first, then 1, then
3. In this case, it is very important to have the text tools exactly at
the same x position (through right click -&gt; style tab you can check
this most easily).</p>
<h3 id="pictures">Pictures</h3>
<p>It is also possible to use images as links to footnotes. When
clicking on the image or moving over it with the mouse cursor the
popover will be show. In order to use an image as a footnote click the
menu icon on the bottom right of the image (or right click the image) in
order to open the context menu. Click the item “add footnote” from the
context menu and fill in the appearing dialog window.</p>
<p><a id="references"></a></p>
<h2 id="references">References</h2>
<p>The reference feature allows you to build a bibliography for your
exposition. It is available for both <em>graphical</em> and
<em>block</em> pages.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-reference">Creating a reference</h3>
<p>You can create a new reference by going to the Ref tab, which is
located on the right-hand side of the workspace editor. Click the +
button to create a new reference. A dialog will open with a form to
enter the reference data.</p>
<figure>
<img loading="lazy" src="images/ref-tab.png"
title="a dialog with tabs, showing a tab for each type of reference"
alt="create reference" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">create reference</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Alternatively you can also import references from external managers
(for example: Zotero, Menderley &amp; Jabref). The format used is <a
href="https://www.bibtex.com/">BibTeX</a>. You can also import multiple
reference items in one go.</p>
<p>The RC currently supports the following reference types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Book</li>
<li>Chapter (of a book)</li>
<li>Journal (article)</li>
<li>Website</li>
<li>Master Thesis</li>

<li>Video</li>
<li>Score</li>
<li>Artwork</li>
<li>Recording</li>
<li>Exposition</li>
<li>Misc</li>
</ul>
<p>Each item will have different fields. Fields marked with * are
required. In case none of the types fit, you may choose to use Misc,
which stands for miscellaneous.</p>

<p>By default, this type of link is constructed from the last name of
the first author and the year. You can customize the text of the link by
selecting it and typing over it, for example to include a page number.
The links will use the default hyperlink color, that can be customized
in the <strong>Page</strong> settings page.</p>

<p>The table of content is designed to facilitate the navigation through
an exposition. Both pages and locations within a page can be added in
the table of content. In order to edit the table of content, go to the
<strong>“Options”</strong> menu &gt; <strong>“Edit Table of
Content”</strong>.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Table of content dialog</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To make a new entry, click on the index number and select the page
(or “weave”) from the drop down menu and click submit.</p>
<p>There are two optional fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Title</strong><br />
Specify a custom name for this entry to be used within the contents
menu. If left empty, it uses the title from the editor.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tool</strong><br />
You can use a tool coordinates as an entry point. You will be provided
with the list of tools in the exposition. This also means if you later
change the tool position, this entry will still point to the same tool.
It is recommended to name the intended tools in a clear way, so you can
better find them from the list.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>X-COORD &amp; Y-COORD</strong><br />
you can use this to create an entry that has an offset, which
immediately opens the page on a specific location within the exposition.
The X,Y values correspond to an offset in pixels. The Y offset is
measured from the top. Instead of looking these values up by hand, you
may also use <a
href="#set-default-position-show-current-position"><strong>options -&gt;
show current position</strong></a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Tip: you can easily reorder the table of contents entries by
clicking and dragging the boxes.</em></p>
<h3 id="static-navigation-bar">Static navigation bar</h3>
<p>At the bottom of the <strong>table of content</strong> dialog, there
is an option <strong>static menu bar</strong> to display the navigation
bar continuously (instead of automatically hiding it).</p>
<h3 id="toc-alignment">TOC alignment</h3>
<p>Choose whether the links in the content menu should be displayed

<h2 id="hyperlinking">Hyperlinking</h2>
<p>See the <a
href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/273532/1685164">video
tutorial</a> on this topic.</p>
<p>It is possible to create hyperlinks between pages (or “weaves”) of an
exposition and within a single page. This process has two steps: First
fetch the link and then create the hyperlink.</p>
<p>In order to fetch a link to a different page within your
exposition:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Open the page you want to link <strong>to</strong> in the editor
(through the page tab on the right hand side).</p></li>
<li><p><em>(optional)</em> scroll the page to the position where you
want the link to point to.</p></li>
<li><p>Right click any tool you want to link to and click “copy tool
link”.</p>
<figure>
<img loading="lazy" src="images/copy-tool-link2.png"
title="context menu, copy-tool-link is the second option"
alt="context menu showing the copy tool link command" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">context menu showing the copy tool link
command</figcaption>
</figure></li>
</ol>
<p>In the graphical editor it is also possible to create a link that
points to your current (absolute) position in the editor. To fetch such
a “position link”, use the menu <strong>options &gt; show current
position</strong> and copy the url.</p>
<p>To use the hyperlink in your text:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create or open a <a href="#text-tool">Text</a> or <a
href="#HTML-tool">HTML tool</a> and select a word or sentence that
should become the link.</li>
<li>Now click the hyperlink button (it looks like a chain link) and a
dialog will be displayed. <img loading="lazy" src="images/html-hyperlink.png"
alt="location of the hyperlink button in text tool" /> <img
src="images/text-hyperlink.png"
alt="location of the hyperlink button in the html tool" /></li>
<li>Paste the link in the <strong>link URL</strong> field and click
<strong>add link</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Optionally you can change the target property, to have the link open
in a new window. Note that if you have not selected any text, the link
dialog will not offer a hyperlink option.</p>
<figure>
<img loading="lazy" src="images/hyperlink-dialog.png" alt="Hyperlink dialog window" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Hyperlink dialog window</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="dialog-options">Dialog options:</h3>
<p>Within the hyperlink dialog there are a couple of options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Link URL</strong> : here you can type or paste a link</li>
<li><strong>Target</strong> : control whether the link will open in a
new screen or not.</li>
<li><strong>Title</strong> : change the title of the link</li>
<li><strong>Class</strong> : set the class of the link (this is rarely
used)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Within the “Overview” tab on the right-hand side of the editor there
is a checkbox labeled “Overview.” Clicking the checkbox will open and
close a tab on the right-hand side of the editor. It contains both a map
and a list of all objects in the exposition.</p>
<p>The overview map outlines all tools on the page, their size and
position. By moving the red rectangle, one can jump to a specific
position on the page.</p>
<p>Below the overview map, there is a list of all objects. If you click
one of these tools, you go directly to that tool’s location. This can
also be very useful when trying to find tools that have somehow become
hidden, for example if another tool has been placed on top.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="images/edit-menu-2018.png" class="half-image" alt=" the edit menu"></p>
<p><strong>Trivial copy paste functions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>cut - ctrl + K</li>
<li>copy - ctrl + C</li>
<li>paste - ctrl + V</li>
<li>duplicate - ctrl + D</li>
<li>delete - delete (Apple: fn + backspace) (ctrl = cmd on Mac
computers)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Order functions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>bring to front</li>
<li>bring to back</li>
</ul>
<p>These options change the order of objects if they overlap. Order can
be important if you have tools with controls: for example, an audio
player that is behind a text tool would need to be in front to allow the
user to click the play button on it.</p>
<p><strong>Locking:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>lock</li>
<li>unlock</li>
</ul>
<p>Locking an object means it cannot be changed or moved in any way
(until it is unlocked). This feature can also be used if only part of
the exposition is to be moved (by locking the objects you do not want to
move).</p>
<h3 id="arrange-menu">Arrange menu</h3>
<p>These functions help with aligning (two or more) tools. To select
multiple tools, click them one by one while holding ctrl/cmd key, then
choose the function you want to apply from the arrange menu.</p>

<li>right edges: all right sides will be aligned</li>
<li>top : all top sides will be aligned</li>
<li>bottom : all bottom sides will be aligned</li>
<li>center on vertical axis : the tools will all be centered around one
vertical line (like centered text !)</li>
<li>center on horizontal axis : the horizontal middle of the tools will
al be on the same horizontal line</li>
<li>distribute left edges equally: the left and rightmost tool stay in
the same place, equally space the left sides of the tools in
between</li>
<li>distribute top edges equally: the top and bottom tool stay the same,
equally space the top sides of the tools in between</li>
<li>make vertical gaps equal: the gaps between tools are all made the
same (by dividing the sum of gaps equally)</li>
<li>make horizontal gaps equal: the horizontal gaps between tools are
made equal.</li>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The text-based editor is aimed at creating <a
href="http://https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_webdesign">responsive</a>
RC expositions. Despite the “text” in the name, expositions made with
this editor can also contain images, video, audio or PDF. “Text based”
refers to the method of editing: through plain text. Because of this
plain text input, text-based expositions can be easily imported or
edited in external editors. The consequence is that editing the visual
layout is less direct as in the graphical based editor. The structure of
the exposition is expressed by using Markdown, the display of which can
be customized through style sheets (css).</p>
<p>On desktop, the editor splits the screen in two: you can write your
text on the left side <a href="#editor">editor</a> while the result is
shown as a <a href="#preview">preview</a> on the right hand side. It is
also possible to <a href="#import-export">import</a> the text from
external formats like Word and Open Office. Formatting
(<strong>bold</strong>,<em>italic</em> etc…) is added using <a
href="#markdown">markdown</a> notation.</p>
<p>If you want to insert <a href="#introduction"
title="video, audio, image or PDF">media</a>, you can add these through
the <a href="#upload-media"><strong>“upload media”</strong> button </a>.
When the upload has finished, the media edit dialog will automatically
open, allowing you to edit and insert it.</p>
<p>Finally, the look of your text and media can be controlled through
the media list and the style editor.</p>
<h2 id="creation-and-using-a-template">Creation and using a
template</h2>
<p>To create a text-based exposition, go to “my profile” and click <a
href="#create-exposition">create exposition</a>, then select
“text-based” for the editor type. Additionally, you can select a
template, which will mean your new exposition will be pre-filled with
the stylesheet and, depending on the template, some placeholder
text.</p>
<p>Because the text-based and graphical formats are completely
different, you can only change the editor type the moment you create a
new exposition.</p>
<p>Portal admins can select any of their own expositions to become a
template for their portal users, by going to the “template” tab in their
<a href="#portal-settings-screen">portal settings</a>.</p>
<h2 id="editor">Editor</h2>
<p>The left hand side is where you can edit your text. The editor uses
<a href="#markdown" title="link to markdown docs">Markdown</a>, which is
a lightweight, human-friendly <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language">markup
language</a>. Because Markdown is expressed as plain text, you cannot
directly change the styling of the text (font-size, color etc.. are
edited in <a href="#edit-style">style</a> ), but you can express the
structure/markup of your text. See <a href="#markdown"
title="more about markdown">Markdown</a> for a brief overview.</p>
<p>By default the editor uses colors to show the Markdown elements in
your text, but you can also choose “plain txt” which allows your
browsers spellchecker to work. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<h2 id="pages-table-of-contents">Pages / table of contents</h2>
<p>The text based editor is limited to single page articles. Headers
marked with <code>#</code> will be included in the “contents” menu
automatically.</p>
<h2 id="previews">Previews</h2>
<p>Here you can see a preview of your exposition.</p>
<p>Because text based expositions are responsive (react to the size of
the window), the result may change based on the width of the screen. For
a full view preview, use the eye button in the toolbar.</p>
<h3 id="upload-media">Upload media</h3>
<p>To add new media, click upload media. After the upload finishes, the
media edit dialog opens. This allow you to edit its metadata, size and
to insert the media at the current cursor position.</p>
<p>If you want to insert previously used media, you can use the “media
button” in the <a href="#toolbar">toolbar</a>.</p>
<h2 id="media-list">Media list</h2>
<p>All media that you uploaded will appear in the “media list”, where
they can be edited or deleted.</p>
<p>[The media list](images/media-list-elm.png ” media list”)</p>
<h3 id="editing-media">Editing media</h3>
<p>From within the media-list, if you click [<strong>edit</strong>], you
will be able to change the <strong>name</strong>,
<strong>metadata</strong> and display of a media file.</p>
<ul>
<li>name (also used for the tag)</li>
<li>change the way the files is displayed (size, float left/right)</li>
<li>add copyright info</li>
<li>choose a license</li>
<li>add description <br><br><br />
Using the buttons in the list itself:</li>
<li>remove the object from your exposition</li>
<li>insert the object in the current position in the text.</li>
</ul>
<p>[The media edit dialog](images/edit-media-elm.png ” the edit media
dialog”)</p>
<h2 id="insert-media">Insert media</h2>
<p>Media is represented on the editor side using a
!{<em>media-name</em>} tag. The easiest way of inserting such a media
tag is throught the <a href="#insert-toolbar-button">insert media
toolbar button</a>, which shows a list of available media that can be
inserted. Double click any item to insert.</p>
<figure>
<img loading="lazy" src="images/insert-media-elm.png"
title="inserting media using the insert button"
alt="inserting media using the insert button" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">inserting media using the insert
button</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can also write the media tags directly, for example: to insert a
media named “myFile”, you can directly write !{myFile}. This !{myFile}
tag will be the location in your text where myFile will be inserted.</p>
<p>A <strong>caption text</strong> can also be included, to get a
caption you write [my caption text]{myFile}. The caption text is
displayed underneath the media.</p>
<h2 id="import-export">Import &amp; export</h2>
<p>You can import content from documents from text editors like Word
(.docx), Libre/Open Office (.odt), HTML and several other formats. Not
all styling is supported but images, footnotes, tables and most other
structural features of the text are. Best results will be achieved if
the document that is imported has a simple structure. When you import a
a document, it will not replace the current content, but be appended at
the end of your page.</p>
<h2 id="edit-style">Edit style</h2>
<p>Text based expositions are styled using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets),
which is a standard way of styling web documents. The CSS of an
exposition can be edited by going to the <strong>style</strong> tab. If
you are not familiar with CSS, there is a good introduction here: <a
href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/"
class="uri">https://www.w3schools.com/css/</a>.</p>
<p>The structure of inserted media is as follows. You can use the
outside class (rc-media-123455) to style an individual media
element.</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;div class=&quot;rcobject small [rcimage/rcpdf/rcvideo/rcaudio]rc-media-[media id]&quot;&gt; 
        &lt;figure id=&quot;media-1&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;...&quot;&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt; Caption text, which is taken from the tag -&gt; ![captiontext]{media1} 
            &lt;/figcaption&gt; 
        &lt;/figure&gt; 
    &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Most templates will provide some basic formatting already, that you
can adjust to your needs.</p>
<h2 id="toolbar">Toolbar</h2>
<p>From left to right:</p>
<ul>
<li>H1, H2 &amp; H3 - insert <a href="#headers">header</a>

this mode)</li>
<li><img class="icon" src="images/icons/screen-full.svg"> - Fullscreen

</ul>
<h2 id="markdown">Markdown</h2>
<p>Markdown is a human-friendly way of writing HTML webpages without
using code. Markdown is written as plain text (like you would write on a
typewriter), that is translated into HTML for you.</p>
<p>By surrounding your words with a few special characters you can
inform markdown which styling you want it to use.</p>
<p><a id="strong-emphasis"></p>
<p>For example:<br />
<em>italic</em> = <code>*italic*</code><br />
<strong>bold</strong> = <code>__bold__</code></p>
<p>Instead of typing these characters, you can also select a piece of
text and push the desired <strong>style button</strong> on top of the
editor. This will insert the correct Markdown notation for you.</p>
<h3 id="paragraphs-and-newlines">Paragraphs and newlines</h3>
<p>Single newlines are ignored by Markdown, unless:</p>
<ul>
<li>are made explicit by adding two spaces</li>
<li>preceded by the <strong>backslash</strong> character
“<code>\</code>”</li>
<li>there are two newlines, which means there is one empty line.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are some examples to illustrate the behaviour. In the
<em>input</em> the position of newlines is shown with
<code>⏎</code>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>A single newline character is ignored (!)</strong></p>
<em>input:</em>
<pre>This text will⏎</pre>
<pre>be joined together</pre>
<p><em>results in:</em></p>
<p><span class="bg-red">This text </span><span class="bg-blue">will be
joined together</span></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>An empty line will start a new paragraph</strong></p>
<p>If you create an empty line, by hitting enter twice ( ⏎⏎ ) , it will
create a new paragraph in the output.</p>
<p><em>input:</em></p>
<pre><code>a paragraph some text and some other
text. a paragraph some text and some other

<hr />
<p><strong>Two spaces at the end of your line will retain the

<p><em>results in:</em></p>
<p><span class="bg-red">This line has two spaces at the end</span><br>

<h3 id="headers">Headers</h3>
<p>Headers are defined by using one or more "#" in front of the header
name:</p>
<p><code># header 1</code><br> <code>## header 2</code><br>
<code>### header 3</code><br></p>
<p>There are six levels of headers. Header level 1, 2 and 3
(<code>#</code>,<code>##</code>,<code>###</code>) are automatically
included in the <strong>contents</strong> menu, for easy navigation for
the reader.</p>
<p>An alternative way of writing headers is by putting ===== or — below
you header text.</p>
<p><code>Header 1</code><br />
<code>========</code></p>
<p><code>Header 2</code><br />
<code>----------</code></p>
<h3 id="lists">Lists</h3>
<p>To get a bullet point list, write * before each item. Before the
first item, keep an empty line. Thus, when you write:</p>
<pre><code>* my first point
* another throught
* yet another thought</code></pre>
<p>it will result in</p>
<ul>
<li>a list</li>
<li>which has</li>
<li>three items</li>
</ul>
<p>To get ordered lists, write a number and a point, 1. , 2. , 3.</p>
<pre><code>1. one
2. two
3. three</code></pre>
<h3 id="links">Links</h3>
<p>Hyperlinks are written in the following manner:
<code>[linktext](http://example.com)</code><br />
which results in:<br />
<a href="http://example.com">linktext</a></p>
<p>You can also use create internal links, called <em>anchors</em>. The
link is made by writing a hashtag (#) before the name of your
anchor:</p>
<p><code>[link](#your-anchor-id)</code></p>
<p><em>note the ‘#’, without this it will not work!</em></p>
<p>The anchor (or bookmark) itself is created like this:</p>
<p><code>&lt;a id="your-anchor-id"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>
<h3 id="footnotes-text-based">Footnotes (text based)</h3>
<p><a id="text-based-footnote"></a></p>
<p>The easiest way of inserting a footnote is using the footnote button:
[ <strong>*</strong> ]. Footnotes consist of two parts, the reference,
written like so:</p>
<p><code>[^1]</code></p>
<p>Then you define the footnote content at the bottom of your text
with:</p>
<p><code>[^1]: This is my footnote.</code></p>
<p>The footnote content is automatically moved to the bottom of the
resulting text.</p>
<p>Tip: the footnote identifier, does not have to be a number. You can
also use names like (<code>[^fn1]</code> or <code>[^myfootnote]</code>
etc..)</p>
<h3 id="quotation">Quotation</h3>
A quotation is inserted by indenting your text with 4 spaces or 1 tab,
like so:
<pre> ` quotation` ` more quotation` </pre>
<p>Quotations are not automatically formatted (they keep their
newlines).</p>
<h3 id="tables-markdown">Tables (markdown)</h3>
<p>Tables are written like this:</p>
<pre>
| Name | Age | Species |
|---------|-----|---------|
| Harry | 23 | Human |
| Gerhard | 77 | Parrot |
| Judith | 6 | Cat | </pre>
<table>

<h1 id="html-import">HTML Import</h1>
<p>It is possible to import a website of static HTML into the RC. This
feature is aimed at users that are familiar with HTML and want to use
their own editor.</p>
<p>For security reasons, JavaScript is not supported, but CSS files,
<code>&lt;img&gt; &lt;video&gt; &lt;audio&gt;</code> tags can be used.
The folder containing your HTML and media files are to be uploaded as a
single zip file (.zip). The maximum filesize is 10Gb, although for
practical reasons it is probably more convenient to stay well below
this.</p>
<p><em>Important: at this moment, the existing RC Journals do not accept
submissions imported as HTML, because they do not fit in existing
reviewing/editing workflows. If you are planning to submit your
exposition to one of the journals in the RC, one should use the
graphical or the text-based editor.</em></p>
<p>To create a HTML based exposition:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Click [ Create Exposition ] on your profile page.</li>
<li>Select “html based” as the editor, fill in required metadata fields
and click submit.</li>
</ol>
<figure>
<img loading="lazy" src="images/selecting-html-import.png" title="html import editor"
alt="selecting html import editor" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">selecting html import editor</figcaption>
</figure>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>You will now enter an upload screen, where you can select your
zip.</li>
</ol>
<figure>
<img loading="lazy" src="images/upload-html-expo.png" title="the upload screen"
alt="the upload screen" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">the upload screen</figcaption>
</figure>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>Wait for upload to finish</p>
<p>When the upload finished and there is no error, you can view the
exposition by clicking the preview button (eye in the top right corner).
If it is not succesful you can use the error message to see what changes
you may need to make and try again.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="requirements-for-html-expositions">Requirements for HTML
expositions</h3>
<p>There are a few requirements to the zip that is uploaded:</p>
<ul>
<li>The root folder needs to contain a file named index.html, this will
be the page where the exposition opens.</li>
<li>All other HTML files in the root folder will be added to the table
of contents.</li>
<li>Do not nest folders into folders.</li>
<li>You can use .html .css and various media formats, mp4, mp3 etc.. The
RC will automatically transcode the video and audio to a web compatible
format.</li>
<li>JavaScript is currently not supported for security reasons, if
present, import will fail.</li>
<li>Maximum size is 10Gb.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="character-encoding">character encoding</h3>
<p>The character encoding of the .html files should be UTF-8. You should
specify the character encoding first (before
<code>&lt;title&gt;</code>), for example like so:</p>
<p><code></p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
&lt;title&gt;my exposition&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
etc... </code></pre>
<p></code></p>
<h3 id="example-exposition">Example exposition</h3>
<p>An example HTML-based exposition for use in the RC can be found on
Github:</p>
<p><strong>source:</strong> <a

<h3 id="updating">Updating</h3>
<p>Currently, it is not possible to update single files within your
uploaded exposition. When something changes, you will have to upload the
whole exposition again.</p>
<!-- TODO: Insert links to other parts of the documentation -->
<h1 id="navigation">Navigation</h1>
<h2 id="navigation-bar">Navigation bar</h2>
<p>When one moves the mouse cursor to the top of an exposition, a menu
bar appears.</p>
<figure>
<img loading="lazy" src="images/navigation-bar.png" title="the navigation bar"
alt="the RC navigation bar" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">the RC navigation bar</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The navigation bar contains, from left to right:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Content</strong><br />
This contains the table of contents and links to the authors. Please see
the help section on <a href="#table-of-content">table of
contents</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Navigation</strong> (graphical expositions only)<br />
Navigation is a graphical map of all the exposition’s content on the
current weave. You can click it to jump to a location.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Abstract</strong><br />
Abstract, this can be changed by clicking title in the editor or ☰ &gt;
<strong>edit details</strong> on your profile.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Title / citation info</strong><br />
By moving the mouse pointer the title of your research, a little window
with citation info will appear. The link (URL) of the current page is
shown, including the current scrolling location. This URL can thus be
used to generate the <a href="#hyperlinks">hyperlink</a> for internal
linking. You can also use this link to cite a specific location within
an exposition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Meta</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Takes you to the metadata page, which shows the full set of metadata
related to the exposition: author(s), keywords, abstract, creation date,
publication date and copyright &amp; licenses of all used media
files.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reviewing</strong> (graphical expositions only)<br />
Reviewing is connected to the note tool (the yellow “post-it” notes) and
is intended for the communication between the author(s) and the reviewer
during the reviewing-process. This option is only available for
expositions that have not been published yet. Notes can also be used for
approving expositions in educational contexts.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /> There are a couple of functions available: <br /> - hide notes
(hide all notes) - show open notes (show only notes that are open) -
show resolved notes (show the resolved notes) - add new note (open a
note tool) - previous note (jump to previous note) - next note (jump to
next note)</p>
<h3 id="comments">Comments</h3>
<p>Shows the latest and previous comments on your exposition from the RC
community.</p>
<h3 id="terms-of-use">Terms of use</h3>
<p>This displays the terms of as set by the Society for Artistic
Research (SAR).</p>
<h1 id="collaboration-sharing-and-publication">Collaboration, Sharing
and Publication</h1>
<p>By default, expositions are <strong>private</strong>: only visible to
your account. These are the three options to make something visible to
others:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#collaborating-on-research">collaborate</a>: invite
individual RC users to view, comment or edit your exposition.</li>
<li><a href="#share">share</a>: make your research visible to other
people, but you can still change the content or make it private again.
Others will not be able to edit. By sharing, the exposition will appear
on the front page, your public profile, and search results. You can also
connect a shared exposition to a Group or Portal, this way it will
appear there as well (as the other locations).</li>
<li><a href="#publication">publishing</a>: self-publish, or request
publication within one of the portals. You cannot edit the content after
publication.</li>
</ul>
<p class="red">
An important feature of <strong>publication</strong> in the RC, is that
it is <strong>permanent</strong>. This means that once an exposition is
published, content will be locked forever. The idea behind this is that
the content of published expositions can be safely referenced by others
without risk of linking to something that has changed or disappeared.
</p>
<h2 id="collaborating-on-research">Collaborating on Research</h2>
<p>The Research Catalogue allows you to work together on a research
exposition with one or more users. This is called collaboration.</p>
<p>There are 3 types of collaborators:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>co-author</em> : The collaborator is considered a co-author of
the research and will be shown in the author list of the research
exposition. They <strong>can read and edit</strong> all content.</li>
<li><em>contributor</em> : This type of collaborator has the same rights
but won’t feature as co-author of your exposition. An example of a
contributor might be a graphic designer helping with the layout of your
exposition without having any involvement with the research itself. They
<strong>can read and edit</strong> all content.</li>
<li><em>supervisor</em> : The collaborator can view an exposition and
leave comments. A supervisor can only <strong>read</strong> the content,
not edit.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-owner-role">The <em>owner</em> role</h3>
<p>Every exposition has exactly one owner. The owner is one of the
author(s), and has some extra capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can delete the exposition.</li>
<li>Can submit a publication request for the exposition.</li>
<li>Can request connecting it to a Project or Portal.</li>
</ul>
<p>The owner can also select one of the other authors to be the owner.
Be aware that this will remove the privileges from the previous
owner.</p>
<h3 id="adding-a-collaborator">Adding a Collaborator</h3>
<p>An author of an exposition can invite collaborators through the
collaboration tab of the exposition: click the <strong>menu
icon</strong> (1) and <strong>‘edit details’</strong> (2) next to the
research on your profile. If you are already in the workspace editor,
you can also use <strong>options</strong> &gt; <strong>edit
details</strong> to open the same menu.</p>

<p>Choose <strong>‘collaboration’</strong>, search for the user you want
to cooperate with and add the collaborator by clicking on their name.
Only users with full accounts can be collaborated with, and limited
accounts will not show up if you try to find them.</p>

After clicking submit, collaborators will receive an invitation from you
in their collaboration page.</p>
<h2 id="accepting-a-collaboration-invitation">Accepting a collaboration
invitation</h2>
<p>You can find all collaboration invitations under <a
href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/collaboration/list"
class="uri">https://www.researchcatalogue.net/collaboration/list</a>. At
the bottom of the list of invitations, you can find the
<strong>backlog</strong>. In the backlog you can easily find all your
past collaboration interactions, including links to the expositons &amp;
groups that you have been invited to. If you have “collaboration”
notifications switched on in your profile settings, you will also
recieve an email when somebody invites you.</p>

<p>Note: If a user’s name in the list is enclosed in brackets ( [ name ]
), it means that the invitation is sent successfully, but has not been
yet accepted by the receiver.</p>
<h2 id="realtime-collaboration">Realtime collaboration</h2>
<p>For pages created with the graphical editor, you will see the edits
of the others directly as they are made, in the other editors (block,
html or text-based) you will have to refresh your browser tab to see
changes. When a tool is being edited by another user, it will get a
<span class="blue">blue</span> border. When a page is being edited by
another user, it will be highlighted in <span
class="blue">blue</span>.</p>
<h3 id="communication-with-collaborators">Communication with
Collaborators</h3>
<p>While collaborating on an exposition, there are several ways of
communicating with each other:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>chat</strong> In the graphical exposition editor, you can
chat with your collaborators.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Using the note tool</strong> Notes are the RC equivalent
of yellow paper notes. You can simply drag one from the toolbar onto the
exposition workspace. See also the note tool help. The note tool
currently is not supported in block style pages.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Send collaboration message</strong> You can send a direct
text message to your collaborator using the <em>Send collaboration
message</em> found under the <strong>commands</strong>_ tab.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Posting a comment</strong> In expositions where you are
not a collaborator, you can still leave comments by going to the top bar
of the exposition and clicking the <strong>Comments</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<!-- TODO: Insert links to other parts of the documentation -->
<p><a id="publishing-and-sharing"></a></p>
<p>Instead of collaborating with RC users you can also <a
href="#publish"><strong>publish</strong></a> an exposition or <a
href="#share"><strong>share</strong></a> share it with groups of people.
The difference is when an exposition is <strong>shared</strong>, content
can still be changed, and the mode of sharing can be changed at a later
point.</p>
<h2 id="share">Share</h2>
<p><strong>Share</strong> option can used to control visibility of works
and expositions for groups of people. By default, your expositions are
<strong>private</strong>, changing the mode allows others to see your
work. Unlike <strong>publishing</strong>, you will still be able to
change the content of an exposition when it is shared. Share settings
can not be changed while the exposition is in review.</p>
<p>The share option can be found under the object menu (<img
class="tiny_icon" src="images/menu.png" alt="hamburger menu icon">) of
each object on your profile.</p>
<p>There are four modes of sharing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>private</strong> (<strong>default</strong>) : only visible
to you or the <a href="#collaborating-on-research"
title="collaboration">collaborators</a> on that specific object.</li>
<li><strong>only RC users</strong> : visible to users with an RC
account.</li>
<li><strong>limited to portal</strong>: visible only to members of a
certain portal within RC. Clicking a portal in the list below, toggles
visibity of your exposition for members of that portal. If required, you
can also select multiple.</li>
<li><strong>public</strong> : visible to anyone on the internet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Independent of the above choices there is a check box:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>link share</strong> : The object is accessible through a
“secret” link. Only people that have the link can view the object. This
is useful for sharing with readers without an RC account, by turning the
option on and mailing them the link.</li>
</ul>
<p>A common use is to keep the exposition private but share the link
with a few persons, via e-mail for example. Note that even if you tick
the link share box, you still need to apply this change by using the
“submit” button. Remember to copy the link first.</p>
<p>Link share can be combined with any of the other sharing modes
(private, RC users, limited to portal, public). An exposition can for
example be shared within a portal but simultaneously be accessible
through the “secret” link.</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="publication">Publication</h2>
<p><strong>Publication</strong>, is permanent. This means that once an
exposition is published, all content will be locked. The idea behind
this is that the content of published expositions can be safely
referenced by others without risk of linking to something that has
changed or disappeared. You can self-publish an exposition, or request
publication with one of the portals. Please consult the portal pages:
(<a
href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/institutions">institutions</a>
or <a
href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/journals">journals</a>)
to see what requirements there are for publication there.</p>
<h3 id="self-publish">Self-Publish</h3>
<p>Self-publishing makes an exposition <strong>no longer
editable</strong> and publicly visible. On publication you will get a
(free) <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier">DOI</a>.
By design, publishing an exposition is not reversible (so others can use
the exposition link as a reference).</p>
<h3 id="submit-for-review">Submit for review</h3>
<p>Expositions can also be submitted to portals (such as journals) for
review and publication. Most of the institutional portals will only
accept requests from within the institution that is associated with it.
In case you want to submit to an institutional portal, be sure to check
their instructions regarding submissions: (<a
href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/institutions">institutions</a>
or <a
href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/journals">journals</a>).</p>
<p>To request review within a portal, click ☰ -&gt; submit for review.
You will be prompted to select to which portal you want to submit. After
submitting, the exposition will show “in review” status.</p>
<p>While the exposition is “in review” state it can no longer be edited.
The portal admin or editor will contact you regarding the reviewing
process. The portal admin can unlock the exposition by putting it “in
revision”, or rejecting the publication request. In the first case you
or the admin can lock it again, in the second case you will have to
resubmit it using the normal method.</p>
<p>After the portal admin accepts the publication request, you will
receive a message and the content of the exposition will be premanently
locked.</p>
<h2 id="connect-to-portal">Connect to Portal</h2>
<p>A shared exposition can be connected to a portal. Connecting shared
exposition will result in the exposition being listed on the portal
page, without locking the content. The important difference with
publication is, that connected expositions can still be changed after
the connection has been made.</p>
<p>To connect an exposition, the main author will have to use the ☰
-&gt; “connect to” option to request connection.</p>
<p>There are two conditions that need to be met before a request can be
made:</p>
<ul>
<li>The main author has to be a member of the portal.</li>
<li>The exposition cannot be private (it has to be at least shared
within the portal, or public).</li>
</ul>
<p>The portal admin will receive a notification and has to confirm the
connection <a href="#connection-requests">(portal-admin
documentation)</a>.</p>
<p>Once the connection has been approved by the portal admin, the
connection will be shown in the expositions metadata and the exposition
may appear on the portal page and portal feeds. Connected works may for
example accompany a published exposition or represent a connected event.
They have to be at least shared within the portal.</p>
<h1 id="groups">Groups</h1>
<figure>
<img loading="lazy" src="images/group-page.png" title="group page"
alt="example group page" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">example group page</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Groups</strong> are a way of having a shared space for
expositions with multiple users, for example for use in a class,
research project or workshop. As a member of the group, you get access
to the group’s overview page, which shows all users and expositions
connected to the group as well as general information. As a member, you
can create (your own) expositions within the group, that will be
directly visible to all the group’s members.</p>
<p>The group may also have one or more admins (administrators). The
group’s admins have the ability to manage the members, expositions and
edit the description and other metadata. They can also set
collaborations for the expositions that are connected to the group. In
some sense the group is a mini-portal within the portal.</p>
<p>The group’s visibility to the outside world can be controlled: it can
be private where only its members have access to it, or it can be shared
in the portal or made completely public.</p>
<p>User groups are created by the portal admin(s). The public groups of
a portal can be found on the <a
href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/institutions">portal feed
page</a>. Private groups of which you are a member appear on your
profile page.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-group-as-a-member">Using the group as a member</h2>
<p>There are two ways to become a member of a group:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The group’s admin invites you. You can accept the request in the <a
href="%22RC%20collaboration%20section%22%20https://www.researchcatalogue.net/collaboration/list">collaboration</a>
section.</li>
<li>You visit a public group page and request membership. In this case
the admin will have to accept you before you get access.</li>
</ol>
<p>Only a full user account can become part of a group. Once you are a
member you can [visit the group] from your own <a
href="%22my%20profile%20page%22%20https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile">profile
page</a>. If you want to create an exposition within the group, you can
do so by clicking the “create exposition” button on the groups page.
Alternatively, you can request one of your expositions to be connected
to the group. To do this, scroll to the exposition on your profile,
click ☰ -&gt; <strong>“Connect to”</strong> menu. <em>Note: you can only
request a exposition to be connected to the groups of which you are a
member.</em></p>
<h2 id="roles-within-groups">Roles within Groups</h2>
<p>There are two roles within the group:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Members</strong> (as described in the previous section):
<ul>
<li>Can view the project page and all expositions within it.</li>
<li>Can create expositions within the group.</li>
<li>Can send a request to connect a exposition from them to a
project.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Admins</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Can view the project page and all expositions within it.</li>
<li>Invite other users to the group.</li>
<li>Accept/reject exposition connection requests.</li>
<li>Change visibility of the group.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>A group can have any number of admins/members. Users can request
membership to a group by visiting the group page and click “request to
become a member”.</p>
<p>Admins will be notified when a connection has been requested, or when
a user indicated they want to become member of the group. The exposition
connections can be accepted within the connections page of the Group.
You can access this on the group’s page and clicking manage
connections.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">location of managing
connections</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When an admin invites a user to become admin or member, the invited
user will have to confirm membership first in
<strong>collaboration</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="group-visibility">Group Visibility</h2>
<p>The group visibility can be changed by the group admin or portal
admin.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>private</strong>: visible only to its members and the portal
admin</li>
<li><strong>visible within the portal</strong>: only members of the
portal can see it</li>
<li><strong>public</strong>: visible to all</li>
</ul>
<p>Expositions connected to the group can be seen by all members (even
if they are otherwise private). The visibility of expositions of
non-members of the group are controlled by each individual exposition
share or publication status.</p>
<p>If a group is public, other visitors will only see expositions that
are explicitely made public. This means there is the possibility to have
private expositions that are only visible to members of the group but
not to anybody else.</p>
<h2 id="admin-role-managing-group-information-and-members">Admin Role,
Managing Group Information and Members</h2>
<p>A group page has a title, description, status, preview image and
member list. Group pages can be found on the portal feed page or on your
profile. When you are admin of the group, you can change the metadata by
clicking edit details on the group page.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-group">Creating a group</h2>
<p>A group can be created, removed and edited by the portal admin under
the group header in the administration interface: <a

<h2 id="securing-your-admin-account">Securing your admin account</h2>
<p>Before we dive in, it is important that you use a strong password for
your portal admin account, as admin rights should not come in the wrong
hands. You can set it under settings.</p>
<p>To create a secure password, either use an automatic password
manager, or use the following method to generate a memorable but
extremely secure passphrase: https://www.eff.org/dice. Do not use a
previously used password.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h2>
<p>This tutorial describes how an RC Portal can be used for publication
workflows. It is aimed at portal administrators (“portal admin”). The
process typically consists of 4 stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>setting up accounts</li>
<li>writing the content by the author(s), possibly in collaboration with
other RC users or editors.</li>
<li>reviewing of the exposition by reviewers</li>
<li>publication</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setting-up-accounts">Setting up accounts</h2>
<h3 id="creating-new-accounts">Creating new accounts</h3>
<p>In most situations, it is best if the portal admin creates the
account(s) for the author(s). Especially when a large number of users
need be created at once. In this case, the responsibility of making sure
that the email address belongs to an actual person lies with the portal
admin (for example, by having an institutional email address). Ideally,
a person should only have <strong>at most one user account</strong> in
the RC (not multiple, to avoid mixups). In case of copyright or other
legal problems the portal admin should be able to provide contact
information to this person.</p>
<p>The administrator can create accounts by going to the <strong><a
href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/admin">admin
section</a></strong> and opening the <strong>user</strong> page. Click
<strong>+</strong> at the right top corner of the screen. After creating
the account, the username (which is an email address) and password can
be sent through email. Be sure to turn of “basic account” in the ROLES
tab (see <a href="#full-account-toggle">roles</a>)</p>
<h3 id="adding-existing-users-to-your-portal">Adding existing users to
your portal</h3>
<p>Sometimes, it happens that a student or author has creates an RC
account on their own, clicking <a
href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/register"
title="Registration on the Research Catalogue">REGISTER</a> on the
research catalogue homepage. After filling in the form the author will
immediatly get a basic account. After this, they can request membership
of your portal through their profile page:</p>
<figure>
<img loading="lazy" src="images/location_of_portal_membership.jpg"
title="member of option location on user profile"
alt="requesting portal membership" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">requesting portal membership</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The portal admin can accept the request through messages.</p>
<p>It is also possible to add these kind of existing users to your
portal (without creating a new account). If you click “create user” in
the portal’s user list, typing a name of an existing user, will make it
show up below the field, If you click the name and then continue to the
next field, the RC will show a pop-up promting if you want to add this
user to your portal.</p>
<h3 id="roles">Roles</h3>
<p><a id="full-account-toggle"></a></p>
<p>To give an account the ability to create expositions, you have to
<strong>disable</strong> the “basic account” option like so:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>click “edit” next to the user</li>
<li>open the “roles” tab</li>
<li>deselect basic user:</li>
</ol>
<figure>
<img loading="lazy" src="images/full_account.jpg"
title="user&#39;s role tab, basic account is deselected"
alt="removing the basic user limitation" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">removing the basic user
limitation</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For safety, admins creating user accounts should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a unique password for each new user.</li>
<li>Make the password sufficiently random (at least 12 completely random
characters).</li>
</ul>
<p>A safer method is to generate a long random password and throw it
away immediately after making the account, then ask the user to reset
the password themselves using <a
href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/forgotten-password"
class="uri">https://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/forgotten-password</a>.
This way you do not have to email passwords or risk storing them.</p>
<p>If you email new users to reset their RC password this way, it is
good to remind them to choose a strong password. Strong passwords
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>generated automatically by a password manager</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to generate a password by hand, you can: - use eff’s
method: <a href="https://www.eff.org/dice"
class="uri">https://www.eff.org/dice</a> - do not use famous phrases,
lyrics or words - never use <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:10,000_most_common_passwords">cliche
passwords, like from the list of 10000 most common passwords</a> -
resist the temptation to reuse passwords - don’t use easily found
personal information - in contrast to common belief, adding a few
numbers ‘!’ ‘#’ ‘.’ ‘,’ characters to a bad password does not guarantee
safety!</p>
<p>Since generating (and remembering!) good passwords is not trivial to
do by hand, most experts recommend using a password manager instead.</p>
<h2 id="writing-the-exposition-collaboration">Writing the exposition,
collaboration</h2>
<p>The next stage is the writing of the <em>exposition</em> itself. The
author does not need to be a member of the portal user list in order to
make a publication request to it.</p>
<p>During the writing stage, it is common that the exposition in
progress is shared with one or more other readers or collaborators.
These collaborators can use the review notes system to leave feedback.
There are three types of collaboration roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>supervisor (no edit permissions, but can leave notes)</li>
<li>co author (full edit permissions)</li>
<li>contributor (full edit permissions, but not mentioned in
meta-data)</li>
</ul>
<p>The author can invite RC users to these roles by going to edit
details or clicking on the title of their exposition in the workspace
editor and choosing “collaboration”. The collaborators will receive an
invitation (in RC messages) that has to be accepted before they can
start to collaborate.</p>
<figure>
<img loading="lazy" src="images/collaboration.png" title="the collabration tab"
alt="collaboration tab" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">collaboration tab</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It is also possible that an author makes the in-progress exposition
content visible to specific groups of users, before publication. This is
done by using the <a href="#share" title="share options in the RC">share
option</a>. Since sharing in this manner is not an official publication,
shared expositions can be unshared (made private again), and will appear
on the author’s profile and not in the portal feed.</p>
<h2 id="requesting-publication">Requesting publication</h2>
<p>Once the writing is sufficiently progressed, the next step is that
the author sents a request to review the exposition. This is done
through the ☰ menu, which is located on the “my profile” in the right
bottom corner of the exposition summary. This will open a dialog where a
portal can be chosen for review and possible publication.</p>
<figure>
<img loading="lazy" src="images/submit_for_review.png"
title="Dialog for submission for review"
alt="Exposition submission dialog" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Exposition submission dialog</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once the author has done this step, no further changes can be made to
the exposition by the author. It will be listed on their profile under
the status “in review”.</p>
<p>The portal admin will receive a message from the RC that a new work
is ready for review. It will also be available under the “reviewing”
section in the <strong><a
href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/admin">admin
section</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The expositions content is locked for the author(s) during the review
process, only the portal admin can edit. If the author needs to revise
the content, it is possible to temporarily open for editing by clicking
the “in revision” button <img
class="icon" src="images/revision-action.png" />. This will open a
dialog where you can put the exposition “in revision”. During revision,
the exposition will remain listed in the reviewing page. Once the author
is done, they can either resubmit themselves from their profile page, or
the administrator can use the button in the “reviewing” page to change
the status back to “in review”.</p>
<p>The RC automatically creates a snapshot of the exposition state every
time the author submits the exposition for review. This allows to trace
between different versions of the exposition later.</p>
<p>If the publication was sent by accident or to the wrong portal, the
publication request can be declined by the portal administrator. The
admin can also do this under <strong>administration &gt;
reviewing</strong> and clicking the <strong>X</strong> next to the
research title. This will also open the exposition for editing
again.</p>
<h3 id="reviewing-assigning-reviewers">Reviewing, assigning
reviewers</h3>
<p>The most common next step is to assign reviewers to this research.
However, for a person to be available as reviewer, they first have
to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>have an RC account</li>
<li>added to the reviewer pool of the portal.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can do so both in one go, by using “create reviewer” button on
the admin reviewer page. This will also work for users that have already
an account in the RC.</p>
<p>The reviewer role does not require a full RC account, it is enough to
be a limited RC user.</p>
<p>For the second requirement, the user has to be added to the reviewer
pool of the portal. This can be done by going to the
<strong>Portal</strong> page of the <strong><a
href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/admin">admin
section</a></strong> and then choosing edit. Under the ROLES tab, RC
users can be added as reviewers for that particular portal.</p>
<p>Once a reviewer is part of the review pool, they can be added to the
research exposition. To do this, go to <strong>review</strong> tab of
the <strong>administration</strong> part of the RC, and click the edit
page. Here you can add (or remove) reviewers to the research. Reviewers
can be either added single blind (they cannot see each other), or double
blind (they cannot see the author’s name).</p>
<figure>
<img loading="lazy" src="images/edit-request.png"
title="edit request, within the review tab"
alt="the edit request page, found when clicking edit icon on an exposition in review" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">the edit request page, found when
clicking edit icon on an exposition in review</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The reviewers will see a list of expositions that they are reviewers
of on top of their “my profile” page. Within the exposition they can use
the “REVIEW” menu to leave notes to themselves, which are only visible
to them and the portal administrator. Typically further communication
between the portal admin and the reviewer takes place through the
messaging system or by e-mail.</p>
<h2 id="final-publication-or-rejection">Final publication or
rejection</h2>
<p>Once the review process has been completed, the portal can choose to
either publish or dismiss the exposition. If the exposition is
dismissed, this means that the editing rights are returned to the
author. The author can resubmit the same exposition later, at which
point the review process starts again. Instead of rejecting, one can
also put the exposition <a href="#in-revision"
title="in revision documentation">“in revision”</a>, which means the
author can make changes, while the exposition is still listed on the
“reviewing” tab of administration.</p>
<p>If the exposition is accepted, the exposition will be frozen
permanently from further changes. You will need to select a range and an
issue for the exposition to be published in.</p>
<p>The range controls to who the exposition will be visible:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>range</strong></th>
<th><strong>who can see it?</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Limited to portal</td>
<td>Members of the portal can see it</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Unlimited</td>
<td>All visitors</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Archived</td>
<td>Portal admins</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><em>Tip: When your portal publishes its very first exposition, you
will first want to create a new issue in the <a
href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/admin/issue/list"
title="link to admin issue page">issue</a> page, since all expositions
need to be part of an issue. The issue’s range should match that of the
exposition. The default range of an issue is unlimited.</em></p>
<figure>
<img loading="lazy" src="images/accept_request.png"
title="Dialog for accepting the request"
alt="Dialog for accepting the publication request" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Dialog for accepting the publication
request</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Depending on the portal settings at this point also a DOI will be
deposited through cross-ref. Please note that publishing is meant as a
one-way step, unpublishing is to be used only as a very last resort. If
one already expects the exposition will be removed in the future, it
should not be published. In that case one could better return the
exposition to the author(s) and have them share it using the standard
sharing options of the RC.</p>
<p>Immediately after publication the exposition will show up on the RC
frontpage (in the case its range is Unlimited). It is recommended that
keywords are added to publications, so they can more easily be
retrieved. Keywords can also be added after publication, on the research
list.</p>

<p>Note: it is not possible for a portal admin to fully delete an
account, however, the RC superadmin can delete an account if necessary.
Please contact <a

arises (for example, duplicate accounts).</p>
<h3 id="add-edit-a-user-dialog">Add / Edit A User Dialog</h3>
<p>Important: when you type a new user name, the RC tries to find if the
user exists already. If it does, the RC will show a dialog requesting if
you want to add the existing user to the portal instead of creating a
new account. It is highly discouraged for a single person to have two
accounts on the RC, so normally admins are expected to simply add this
existing account.</p>

<p>The admins can log in as another user, for example to help resolve
issues with a specific account. While logged in as another user, you
will see a red bar on the top of your window that shows who you are and
enables you to switch back to your own account. This feature is useful
while helping somebody with issues specific to their account.</p>
<p>Keep in mind: you become this user in all the tabs of your browser
window, so you would temporarly loose some of you admin permissions
while navigating as this user.</p>

<h3 id="unpublishing-an-exposition">Unpublishing an exposition</h3>
<p>The unpublishing of expositions is not encuraged. Published
expositions are supposed to be a permament reference, never to be
deleted or changed. If an exposition is to be continuously changed or
temporary, it is better to not publish, but simply set its sharing
settings to <strong>public</strong>. When unpublishing an exposition
make sure with the author of the exposition that there are no connected
works that have been deleted since, otherwise it may be impossible to
reconstruct the publication.</p>
<h2 id="connection-requests">Connection Requests</h2>
<p>It is possible for users to connect a work or exposition to a portal.
The works that have been accepted by an admin of the portal will be
listed here.</p>
<p>A connected exposition will appear on the Portal’s landing page, and
the metadata of the exposition will now mention that is connected to the
portal. They will also appear when searching for expositions within the
portal.</p>
<p>Requests can be accepted with: <strong>V</strong> or rejected with:
<strong>X</strong>.</p>
<p>Once research is connected, the portal admin can add an
<strong>Editor</strong> role to the expositions. The editor is than able
to change the content within the exposition.</p>
<p>They can also add <strong>Supervisor</strong> role, which can only
read the exposition.</p>
<h2 id="reviewing-admin">Reviewing (admin)</h2>
<p>The reviewing page allows managment of expositions that have been
applied for publication by the author. Reviewers or editors can be
assigned to these works. When a reviewer is added they will
automatically recieve a notification from RC that they have been added.
Reviewers can leave notes only visible to themselves (so not to other
reviewers) and the portal admin(s).</p>

<h3 id="in-revision">In revision</h3>
<p>It is possible to put an exposition “in revision”, this means the
author can change the content again, but the exposition remains in the
list on the reviewing page (so the admin can keep track of the
progress).</p>
<p>You will be able to include a message to author, so they are informed
that they can edit the exposition again.</p>
<p>During revision, reviewers will not be able to access the exposition.
They will regain access when the status is changed back to “in review”.
This to ensure that no reviewer is reading an exposition that is
currently being edited. Reviewers’ comments (“yellow sticky notes”) will
be invisible to the author; notes from the portal admin and editors will
be visible to the author.</p>
<p>Either the author can resubmit the exposition using the hamburger
menu, or the portal admin can change the status using the change status
action button:
<img loading="lazy" src="images/revision-action.png" class="icon inline"></p>
<h3 id="publication-dialog">Publication dialog</h3>
<p>When a publication request is accepted, the portal admin can choose
to which issue it belongs and if the publication should be local to the
portal (limited publication) or public (the whole world). Issues can be
created using the <a href="#issue-page"
title="the issue page documentation">issue page</a>. You can also write
a custom message to the author.</p>

<h2 id="issue-page">Issue page</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/admin/issue/list"
title="issue page on the RC">Issue page</a> is an overview page within
the RC that shows all published expositions that are part of an
issue.</p>
<p>An Issue page consists of the title and description of the issue
itself and a gridded preview of all the expositions (title, author,
abstract and a thumbnail). This page is responsive so is easy to read on
a phone as well.</p>
<p>Issues names are managed on this <a
href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/admin/issue/list"
title="issue list page">here</a>.</p>
<p>In the <strong>issue section</strong> (between “portal” and
“research”) of the administration interface, the number, title and
description of issues can be edited.</p>

<p>For the reader, issues can be found through the portals front
page.</p>
<p><a id="admin-groups"></p>
<h2 id="groups-1">Groups</h2>
<p>On the group <a
href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/admin/project/list">overview
page</a> portal admins can create, edit and remove groups. A group can
only be deleted if it no longer has users or expositions connected to
it.</p>

<h1 id="using-json-feeds">Using JSON feeds</h1>
<p>The search functionality of the RC allows you to export metadata of
the portal in JSON format. You can construct a normal query by going to
advanced search from the front page, and select JSON as the output. The
results are always pages with a maximum of 250 results per page.</p>
<p>Here is an example query, to show the 25 most recent publications in
the RC: <a
href="https://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/search-result?fulltext=&amp;title=&amp;autocomplete=&amp;keyword=&amp;portal=&amp;statusprogress=0&amp;statuspublished=0&amp;statuspublished=1&amp;includelimited=0&amp;includeprivate=0&amp;type_research=research&amp;resulttype=research&amp;modifiedafter=&amp;modifiedbefore=&amp;format=json&amp;limit=25&amp;page=0"
class="uri">https://www.researchcatalogue.net/portal/search-result?fulltext=&amp;title=&amp;autocomplete=&amp;keyword=&amp;portal=&amp;statusprogress=0&amp;statuspublished=0&amp;statuspublished=1&amp;includelimited=0&amp;includeprivate=0&amp;type_research=research&amp;resulttype=research&amp;modifiedafter=&amp;modifiedbefore=&amp;format=json&amp;limit=25&amp;page=0</a></p>
<p>The JSON has the following format: <strong>id</strong> : this is the
RC ID, which can also be used to construct links, since it will never
change.</p>
<p><strong>type</strong> : exposition / work /</p>
<p><strong>title</strong> : the full title of the exposition</p>
<p><strong>thumb</strong> : (optional) a thumbnail image of the
exposition, as provided by the author</p>
<p><strong>default-page</strong> : the first page of the exposition</p>
<p><strong>keywords</strong> : open keywords added by the author or
admin, note that this is not a protected vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>created</strong> : date of creation of the exposition
DD/MM/YYYY</p>
<p><strong>status</strong> : - in progress : still being edited, can
also be deleted - published : a permanent exposition, will not be edited
or removed</p>
<p><strong>doi</strong> : if published, most expsoitions will have a
DOI.</p>
<p><strong>published in</strong>: This shows in which portal(s) the
exposition is published in</p>
<p><strong>license</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>all-rights-reserved</li>
<li>CC-BY</li>
<li>CC-BY-ND</li>
<li>CC-BY-SA</li>

</ul>
<p>see details in <a href="#licenses">licences</a></p>
<p><strong>issue</strong>: Portals in the RC always publish their
expositions as part of Issues. For journals these can mean
<strong>issue</strong> as in journal issue, however, other portals also
use it to distinguish between different variaties of research (student,
staff, 3rd cycle etc..)</p>
<p><strong>author</strong>: Internal RC ID (can be used to construct
author profile link:
<code>https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/?person=[id]</code> )
This user will also be the owner (the user that can publish, delete and
rename the exposition and controls who is ).</p>
<p><strong>coauthor</strong>: The other authors of the exposition.</p>
