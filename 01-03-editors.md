# Choosing an Editor 

</a>

  
There are four types of editors in RC: 

- **graphical** editor
- **block** editor
- **text-based** editor 
- **HTML** import

The **graphical**, **block** and **text-based editor** are supported by all portals, the **HTML** based editor may not be accepted by some journals.

When creating a new exposition you are asked to choose a format to
use. Graphical and block pages are part of the same format and can be mixed,
but text and HTML are separate formats. It is therefore important to
make the right choice for a particular project at the outset.

The [**graphical editor**](#workspace-editor), allows the author to
set the position of each element in the page. This makes it easy to
have non-linear formats or presentations in which the media, such as
images, video and audio files, are as important, if not more
important, as the text. The editor works by dragging and
dropping. There is no predefined style or template and it's possible to
have the reader go through the content in a non-linear
fashion. However, a consequence of absolutely positioning all elements
is that the exposition cannot adjust to the size of a particular
device, that is, these expositions are not
["responsive"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design). If
you want readers to be able to read your exposition on mobile device
the block editor or the text-based editor may be more suitable for your project.

The [**block editor**](#block-editor), uses the same tools and
drag-and-drop interface as the graphical editor, but positioning is
relative and the result is
["responsive"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design). It
can be chosen when creating a new page within an exposition. Instead
of an absolute grid, the block editor uses a row and column structure. It is
suitable for dealing with pages that have a lot of "inline" content,
where media is inserted between or beside blocks of text, or media has to be
positioned in relationship to certain elements in a text. It is less
suitable for diagrams, maps or overlayed materials. Expositions can
combine both "graphical" and "block" pages in a single exposition.

The **text-based**, is a completely separate editor, which is
documented [here](#text-based-editor). The editor is designed for
writing (and importing) texts, while supporting the embedding of
media. The input is plain text, which is translated into HTML. The
author can express the structure of the text using
[Markdown](http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
notation. Because the input is plain text, it can also be
automatically imported and exported from and to various external
formats, for example MS Word documents, Open office documents and
LateX. Styling is applied using standard
[CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/ "more information on CSS"). By
default the structure of the exposition is maintained, while the sizes
of the text will adjust for readability on different screen
sizes. Text-based expositions are *responsive*.

**HTML import**

For users that need more customization, there is an option to [import static HTML](#html-import) website as a
whole. The RC does not provide editors for HTML, so for that option an
external editor is to be used. JavaScript is not supported.

Finally, there is an option to import a Research Video, from
