# Choosing an Editor 

The Research Catalogue offers two general-purpose editors:

- **graphical** editor
- **block** editor

*Users can combine both __graphical__ and __block__ pages in a single exposition.*

And two specialized editors (cannot be combined):

- **text-based** editor 
- **HTML** import

When creating a new exposition you are asked to choose which editor you want to start with. Graphical and block pages are part of the same format and can be mixed,
but text and HTML are separate formats. It is therefore important to
make the right choice for a particular project at the outset. For an overview of selected use cases, and how to make an informed decision on the editor choice, please visit [this exposition](https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/2445101/2445102).

Some portals will not accept HTML imported submissions. Please consult the portal beforehand, in case you are planning to submit and want to use the HTML import feature.

The [**graphical editor**](#workspace-editor), allows the author to
set the position of each element in the page. This makes it easy to
build rich graphical pages in which text and media, such as
images, video and audio files, are freely positioned in a infinite canvas. However, due to their non-linear nature, graphical expositions are not
["responsive"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design). If
you want readers to be able to read your exposition on mobile devices, then
either the block editor or the text-based editor might be more suitable for your project.

The [**block editor**](#block-editor), uses the same tools and
the drag-and-drop interface of the graphical editor, but positioning is
relative. As a result, block pages are fully
["responsive"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design). Instead
of an absolute grid and an infinite canvas, the block editor uses a traditional rows-columns structure. It is
suitable for editing pages that have a lot of "inline" content,
where media is inserted between or beside blocks of text, or media has to be
positioned in relation to certain elements in a text. It is less
flexible for creating diagrams, maps, or for overlaying materials.

The [**text-based editor**](#text-based-editor) allows creating blog-like
expositions through writing and editing text. Pages using the text-based editor
cannot be combined with block or graphical editors. The editor is optimized for
writing (and importing) texts, while still supporting the embedding of media.
You can structure and format your exposition using
[Markdown](http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) notation. Content can
be automatically imported and exported from and to various external formats, for
example MS Word documents, Open Office documents and LateX. Styling can be
customized extensively using [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/ "more
information on CSS"). Text-based expositions are *responsive* and thus mobile-friendly.

**HTML import**

For more customization, you can [import a static HTML](#html-import) website as a
whole. JavaScript is not supported.
