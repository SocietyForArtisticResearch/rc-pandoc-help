<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a tutorial to describe how an RC Portal can be used for publication or exam workflows. It is aimed at portal administrators. The process typically consists of 4 stages: setting up accounts, writing, reviewing and publication.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up">Setting up</h2>
<p>In a review process there can be five types of users involved:</p>

<ul>
<li>= Users need to sign the RC agreement letter in order to attain a full account.</li>
</ul>
<p>Limited accounts can either be registered by the user themselves, or by the portal admin. Only a name and e-mail address are required to create such an account. If a portal admin is creating such an account for a reviewer it is recommended that the portal admin switches off the notification/announcement option in the email settings.</p>
<h2 id="first-stage-writing">First stage, writing</h2>
<p>The first stage is the writing of the work itself. Please note that the whole publication process only works with &quot;Expositions&quot; not with Works or Projects etc... The author does not need to be a member of a portal, a normal full rc account (the user has signed the SAR Agreement letter, and his account has been upgraded with full privileges.).</p>
<p>During this stage, it is common that the work in progress is shared with one or more other readers, who can use the notes system to leave feedback. There are three types of collaboration roles: - co author (full edit permissions) - contributor (full edit permissions, not mentioned in meta-data) - supervisor (no edit permissions, but can leave notes)</p>
<h2 id="second-stage-reviewing">Second stage, reviewing</h2>
<p>The second stage starts from the point that the author uses the ☰ menu to publish his work. This will open a dialog where he can choose to which portal the work should be published.</p>
<p>Once the author has done this step, no further changes can be made to the exposition by him/her.</p>
<p>The portal admin will receive a message from the RC that a new work is ready for review. He will also be able to view it under “review” in the administration part of the RC.</p>
<h3 id="assigning-reviewers">Assigning reviewers</h3>
<p>The next logical step is to assign reviewers to this research. However, for somebody to be available as reviewer, they first have to be added to the reviewer pool of the portal. This can be done by going to the Portal page of the administration pages and then choosing edit. Under the ROLES tab, RC users can be added as reviewers for that particular portal. Please note that only users that are already present as an RC user can be added as reviewer, so it may be necessary to first create the account and then add them as reviewer.</p>
<p>Once a reviewer is part of the review pool, they can be added to the research exposition. To do this, go to reviewing tab of the administration par of the RC, and click the edit page. Here you can add reviewers to the research.</p>
<p>The reviewers will see a list of expositions that they are reviewers of on top of their my profile page.</p>
<h2 id="publishing">Publishing</h2>
<p>Once the review process has been completed, the portal can choose to publish or dismiss the exposition. If the exposition is dismissed, this means that the editing rights are returned to the author and if desired, do a new request once the work is ready for a second round of reviewing.</p>
<p>If the exposition is accepted, the exposition will be frozen permanently From further changes. Depending on the portal settings at this point also a DOI will be deposited at cross-ref.</p>
<p>Immediately after publication the exposition will show up on the RC frontpage and visible to any user (also non-RC users). If this is not desired, one can also choose to publish an expotition &quot;limited to the portal&quot;, this means only members of the portal can see the exposition.</p>
