<h1 id="views">Views</h1>
<p>In RC you have three different options to view your exposition. Theese options are strong connected with the way how you work with the different tools on RC.<br />
In general we can differ the workspace view and the preview in browser.<br />
The workspace view is only for you and your collaborators or co-authors and shows you all tools, all files you have uploaded and the way you structure and layout your work on one or more weaves in the framing of the editor. The preview is the way how people from the RC community or the web can see your research in there browsers. It necessary to test the preview in different browsers, because every browser has its own way to display the html-code from your side. RC is mainly supporting the standard-browsers Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Chrome and Internet Explorer.</p>
<h2 id="preview">Preview</h2>
<p>The preview gives you the opportunity to proof the layout of your exposition in the browser. Press PREVIEW on top-right and the preview will start in a new window or tab. By mousing on the top of the exposition in menue-bar will drop down.</p>
<h3 id="home">Home</h3>
<p>Home is your general-navigator. All pages that are named in the meta-tab table of content are listet here. The list will be automatically finished with a link to your personal profile or the profiles of the collaborators and/ or co-authors.</p>
<h3 id="navigation">Navigation</h3>
<p>Naviagation is a grafical in-side-navigator. It shows all content off the present page with frames. So you and your reader have an overview about the dimensions of each page and the content that is presented on each page.</p>
<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>When you add a new research, object or work, you can give them a little abstract, this is displayed under &quot;abstract&quot; in the menue-bar. It's a summary of your work or the question you are working or researching on. It's possible to save this abstract bilingual. Find out how here.</p>
<h3 id="meta">Meta</h3>
<p>By mousing over your account-name and the title of your research, a little window with metainformation will drop-down. The link which is shown, is the hyperlink of your exposition, with the page and the exact coordinates of the content you are looking at in this moment. This URL can be used to generated the hyperlink for intern hyperlinking or naviagation as well as the source you want your work to cite with in external contextes.</p>
<h3 id="reviewing">Reviewing</h3>
<p>Reviewing is strongly connected with the note tool and is made for the communication between the autor(s) and the reviewer during the reviewing-process. This option is not available when the exposition is published.</p>
<h3 id="comments">Comments</h3>
<p>Shows the latest and previous comments to your exposition from the RC community.</p>
<h3 id="terms-of-use">Terms of use</h3>
<p>Terms of use leeds you and your readers to the terms of use of this and any expositions on RC passed by the Society for Artistic Research (SAR)</p>
<h2 id="note-view">Note view</h2>
<p>The note-view is strongly connected to the note-tool of RC. Notes is conceived as a possibilty to make small conversations about specific problems directly at the mentioned content, like sticky notes. Because the usage of notes can be confusing from time to time we developed the note-view. To activate the note-view click on the buttons top-right on the view-options. A new window or tab will open and show you all notes listes aside the layout and the other content of your exposition. You can sort and filter the view with the filter options on the top of the browser. You can sort by the owner or by the assignee of the note or of the resolution, which means, if the note is open to clear or is already cleared.<br />
Next to each note you can find the status-options from the note. Who created this note and who is responsible for clearance (it's necessary when there are more than to authors in the project)? You can limit the clearance to a date and close open notes with the status pull-down-menue. All this options can help you to work efficient and purposeful with the RC.</p>
<h2 id="text-view">Text view</h2>
<p>Sometimes it can be confusing to retrace all the changes in one or more text(s) while editing the exposition. The text-view shields the texts from the grafic and media-content from your exposition. You can activate the the text-view by clicking on the button on the view-options. You have the opportunity to show or hide the changes of a text. You can also sort the items and open the html-editor to make changes directly in the text-view.</p>
<p>You can close both views by clicking on &quot;close vote view&quot; or &quot;close text view&quot; top-right.</p>
