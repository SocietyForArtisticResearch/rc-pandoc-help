# Commands 

The commands tab displayed in the workspace editor contains extra
functions and settings for use in the workspace editor.

### Overview

The overview displays a small window on the right hand side of the
editor. It is useful for navigation on the weave while editing. It
also shows objects that might otherwise be invisible. It will not be
part of your exposition in the preview. In the final presentation of
your exposition there is another navigation window in the menubar,
which is similar to the overview.

Under the overview map there is a list of all the tools (called
layers) that are currently present in the presentation.  When you
click on one, the editor automatically scrolls to that tool. You can
edit, lock or delete a tool with the buttons below the list.

* _tip_: A tool will not scroll into view if it has a negative
  position (outside of your canvas). You can still change the position
  by clicking the edit button at the bottom of the view. *

### Snap to Grid / Grid Size / Invisible Grid

Objects can be aligned to a grid. By default, the grid size is set to
5x5 pixels. You can change the size of the grid by clicking the
pull-down-menu and choosing one of the options from the list. You can
also remove the grid by selecting 'invisible' from the same list.
With "snap to grid" you activate objects will be placed according to
the grid. 

### Set Default Position/ Show Current Position

A rather unique feature of the RC is the absolute positioning of items
on the weave. This makes it possible to position by pixels allowing
for and open very free process of designing and navigating and linking
to specific positions on the weave.

By using _set default position_ you can set the entry position of
your page (which is 0;0 top/left by default) to any other position of
the weave. Scroll to the position you want readers to first when opening your exposition
and click "set default position".

You may want to link to a special position on the weave and you have
to generate the URL for this. After browsing to the coordinates or to
the item you can generate the URL by clicking "show current
position". You can copy the URL and use it for hyperlinking, anchoring
or for publishing.

### Restore Deleted Tools

Every tool or item on the weave can be deleted by using the right-click
(or by using the menu-icon) and selecting the delete function.

It is possible to restore a tool. Because the RC runs within a
browser, you can't use the undo function of your browser or the
shortcut on your keyboard. Every item has its own history which is
listed in the "history"-tab in the edit-tool-dialog. Here you have the
option restore previous states of the object. If the object has been
deleted and is no longer directly accessible and can be restored
deleted using the "restore deleted tools" command. After clicking it,
a list of deleted tool appears. 

### Send Collaboration Message

When you are collaborating on an exposition, you can use the command
"send collaboration message" to commuicate with the co-authors or
contributors. Open the command by clicking on the button and you will
find a message-window. In the upper part you can choose the partners
you want to contact. Select them by clicking on the "+"-icon behind their
names. Below you find a html-based message window. Here you can enter the
message.
