__Trivial copy paste functions:__

* cut - ctrl + K
* copy - ctrl + C
* paste - ctrl + V
* duplicate - ctrl + D
* delete - delete (Apple: fn + backspace)
(ctrl = cmd on Mac computers)

__Order functions:__

* bring to front
* bring to back

These options change the order of objects if they overlap. Order can be important if you have tools with controls: for example, an audio player that is behind a text tool would need to be in front to allow the user to click the play button on it.

__Locking:__

* lock 
* unlock

Locking an object means it cannot be changed or moved in any way (until it is unlocked). This feature can also be used if only part of the exposition is to be moved (by locking the objects you do not want to move).
