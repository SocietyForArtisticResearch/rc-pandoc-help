# Licenses

Authors can choose different licenses for both their expositions and
media.  A license can help make clear under what conditions you allow
your material to be (re)used. All rights reserved is the most strict:
it means that people have to get your permission to use any
material. The motivation to publish works under a more liberal
Creative Commons license, is that it makes it easier for your
materials to be used and distributed by others.

You can get help choosing the right license on the Creative Commons website:
<https://creativecommons.org/choose/> and <https://creativecommons.org/faq/>.
