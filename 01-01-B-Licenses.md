# Licenses

Authors can choose different licenses for both their expositions and
media.  A license can help make clear under what conditions you allow
your material to be (re)used. All rights reserved is the most strict:
it means that people have to get your permission to use any
material. The motivation to publish works under a more liberal
Creative Commons license, is that it makes it easier for your
materials to be used and distributed by others.

The RC provides the following options:

* [all rights reserved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_rights_reserved)\ only with your permission.
  
* CC-BY - [Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) ](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\
  Creative Commons, allow usage (including commercial) as long as you are attributed.

* CC-BY-ND - [Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)\
  Same as CC-BY, but only if the work is used in its original form (and complete). 

* CC-BY-NC-ND - [Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)\
  Same as CC-BY-ND, but prohibits commercial distribution of your work.
  
* CC-BY-NC-SA - [Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)\
  If your work is remixed, transformed, or build upon, creations must distributed under the same license as the original. 

* public domain - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain>\
  No restrictions.

The RC default is CC-BY-NC-ND.
