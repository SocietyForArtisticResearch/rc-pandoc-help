# Views

In RC you have three different options to view your exposition. Theese options are strong connected with the way how you work with the different tools on RC.
In general we can differ the workspace view and the preview in browser.
The workspace view is only for you and your collaborators or co-authors and shows you all tools, all files you have uploaded and the way you structure and layout your work on one or more weaves in the framing of the editor. The preview is the way how people from the RC community or the web can see your research in there browsers. It necessary to test the preview in different browsers, because every browser has its own way to display the html-code from your side. RC is mainly supporting the standard-browsers Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Chrome and Internet Explorer.

## Note view

The note-view is strongly connected to the note-tool of RC. Notes is conceived as a possibilty to make small conversations about specific problems directly at the mentioned content, like sticky notes. Because the usage of notes can be confusing from time to time we developed the note-view. To activate the note-view click on the buttons top-right on the view-options. A new window or tab will open and show you all notes listes aside the layout and the other content of your exposition. You can sort and filter the view with the filter options on the top of the browser. You can sort by the owner or by the assignee of the note or of the resolution, which means, if the note is open to clear or is already cleared.
Next to each note you can find the status-options from the note. Who created this note and who is responsible for clearance (it's necessary when there are more than to authors in the project)? You can limit the clearance to a date and close open notes with the status pull-down-menue. All this options can help you to work efficient and purposeful with the RC.
 
 
 
## Text view

Sometimes it can be confusing to retrace all the changes in one or more text(s) while editing the exposition. The text-view shields the texts from the grafic and media-content from your exposition. You can activate the the text-view by clicking on the button on the view-options. You have the opportunity to show or hide the changes of a text. You can also sort the items and open the html-editor to make changes directly in the text-view.
 
You can close both views by clicking on "close vote view" or "close text view" top-right.
